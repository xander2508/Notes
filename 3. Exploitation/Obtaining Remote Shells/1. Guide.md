# Guide

1. Attempt all other shells before web shells due to reliability
2. Attempt reverse shells even with mismatching languages within reason, e.g. on [[Windows ASPX]] attempt [[PHP]] 
3. **Ensure** that the reverse shells point to a listener on a port the victim also has open

# Bypass Filtering

1. Linux IPs can be written using hex,  e.g.
	* 127 = 0x7f, 0 = 0x00, and 1 = 0x01. So I can ping 0x7f000001
2. Bypass socket filtering with [Shellcode/Socket-reuse - NetSec](https://nets.ec/Shellcode/Socket-reuse) and [GitHub - BorjaMerino/Windows-One-Way-Stagers: Windows Stagers to circumvent restrictive network environments](https://github.com/BorjaMerino/Windows-One-Way-Stagers)
3. Double check open ports.
4. Check firewall rules for potential exploit pathways
