Netcat is a versatile networking tool that is often referred to as the "Swiss Army knife" of networking. It can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as port scanning, transferring files, and creating backdoors. Netcat operates by establishing connections between two computers over a network and can work with both TCP and UDP protocols.

# Guide
