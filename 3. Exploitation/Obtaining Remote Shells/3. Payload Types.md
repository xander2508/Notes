When it comes to creating payloads for Windows hosts, we have plenty of options to choose from. DLLs, batch files, MSI packages, and even PowerShell scripts are some of the most common methods to use. Each file type can accomplish different things for us, but what they all have in common is that they are executable on a host. Try to keep your delivery mechanism for the payload in mind, as this can determine what type of payload you use.
