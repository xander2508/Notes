MSFconsole can manage multiple modules at the same time. This is one of the many reasons it provides the user with so much flexibility. This is done with the use of `Sessions`, which creates dedicated control interfaces for all of your deployed modules.
## Using Sessions

While running any available exploits or auxiliary modules in `msfconsole`, we can background the session as long as they form a channel of communication with the target host. This can be done either by pressing the `[CTRL] + [Z]` key combination or by typing the `background` command in the case of Meterpreter stages. This will prompt us with a confirmation message. After accepting the prompt, we will be taken back to the `msfconsole` prompt (`msf6 >`) and will immediately be able to launch a different module.

#### Listing Active Sessions

```shell-session
sessions
```

#### Interacting with a Session

```shell-session
sessions -i 1
```

##### Module Interacting with Sessions

Modules can utilise an open session to run an exploit on the victim using the open channel. These modules are usually found under the `Post-Exploitation` type. This can be done from the second module's `show options` menu.
