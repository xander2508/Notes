[Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) is an automated attack framework developed by `Rapid7` that streamlines the process of exploiting vulnerabilities through the use of pre-built modules that contain easy-to-use options to exploit vulnerabilities and deliver payloads to gain a shell on a vulnerable system.
# Usage

```
sudo msfconsole
```

## Searching Modules 

```shell-session
search smb
```

Let's look at one module, in particular, to understand it within the context of payloads.

`56 exploit/windows/smb/psexec`

| Output     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `56`       | The number assigned to the module in the table within the context of the search. This number makes it easier to select. We can use the command `use 56` to select the module. |
| `exploit/` | This defines the type of module. In this case, this is an exploit module. Many exploit modules in MSF include the payload that attempts to establish a shell session.         |
| `windows/` | This defines the platform we are targeting. In this case, we know the target is Windows, so the exploit and payload will be for Windows.                                      |
| `smb/`     | This defines the service for which the payload in the module is written.                                                                                                      |
| `psexec`   | This defines the tool that will get uploaded to the target system if it is vulnerable.                                                                                        |
