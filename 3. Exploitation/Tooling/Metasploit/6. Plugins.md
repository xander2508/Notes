Plugins are readily available software that has already been released by third parties and have given approval to the creators of Metasploit to integrate their software inside the framework. These can represent commercial products that have a `Community Edition` for free use but with limited functionality, or they can be individual projects developed by individual people.

## Using Plugins

To start using a plugin, we will need to ensure it is installed in the correct directory on our machine. Navigating to `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins`, which is the default directory for every new installation of `msfconsole`, should show us which plugins we have to our availability:

```shell-session
ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins

aggregator.rb      beholder.rb        event_tester.rb  komand.rb     msfd.rb    nexpose.rb   request.rb  session_notifier.rb  sounds.rb  token_adduser.rb  wmap.rb
alias.rb           db_credcollect.rb  ffautoregen.rb   lab.rb        msgrpc.rb  openvas.rb   rssfeed.rb  session_tagger.rb    sqlmap.rb  token_hunter.rb
auto_add_route.rb  db_tracker.rb      ips_filter.rb    libnotify.rb  nessus.rb  pcap_log.rb  sample.rb   socket_logger.rb     thread.rb  wiki.rb
