`Databases` in `msfconsole` are used to keep track of your results. It is no mystery that during even more complex machine assessments, much less entire networks, things can get a little fuzzy and complicated due to the sheer amount of search results, entry points, detected issues, discovered credentials, etc.

`Msfconsole` has built-in support for the PostgreSQL database system. With it, we have direct, quick, and easy access to scan results with the added ability to import and export results in conjunction with third-party tools. Database entries can also be used to configure Exploit module parameters with the already existing findings directly.

## Setting up the Database

```shell-session
sudo service postgresql status
```

```shell-session
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

```
sudo apt update
```

```shell-session
sudo msfdb init
```

```shell-session
sudo msfdb status
```
