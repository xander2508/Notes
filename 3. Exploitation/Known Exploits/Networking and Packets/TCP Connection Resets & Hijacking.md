## TCP Connection Termination

Suppose an adversary wanted to cause denial-of-service conditions within our network. They might employ a simple TCP RST Packet injection attack, or TCP connection termination in simple terms.

This attack is a combination of a few conditions:

1. `The attacker will spoof the source address to be the affected machine's`
    
2. `The attacker will modify the TCP packet to contain the RST flag to terminate the connection`
    
3. `The attacker will specify the destination port to be the same as one currently in use by one of our machines.`


## TCP Connection Hijacking

For more advanced actors, they might employ TCP connection hijacking. In this case the attacker will actively monitor the target connection they want to hijack.

The attacker will then conduct sequence number prediction in order to inject their malicious packets in the correct order. During this injection they will spoof the source address to be the same as our affected machine.

The attacker will need to block ACKs from reaching the affected machine in order to continue the hijacking. They do this either through delaying or blocking the ACK packets. As such, this attack is very commonly employed with ARP poisoning, and we might notice the following in our traffic analysis.
