Fragmentation serves as a means for our legitimate hosts to communicate large data sets to one another by splitting the packets and reassembling them upon delivery. This is commonly achieved through setting a maximum transmission unit (MTU). The MTU is used as the standard to divide these large packets into equal sizes to accommodate the entire transmission. It is worth noting that the last packet will likely be smaller. This field gives instructions to the destination host on how it can reassemble these packets in logical order.

The idea is to split up the TCP header over several packets to make it harder for packet filters, intrusion detection systems, and other annoyances to detect what you are doing.

Commonly, attackers might abuse this field for the following purposes:

1. `IPS/IDS Evasion` - Let's say for instance that our intrusion detection controls do not reassemble fragmented packets. Well, for short, an attacker could split their Nmap or other enumeration techniques to be fragmented, and as such it could bypass these controls and be reassembled at the destination.
    
2. `Firewall Evasion` - Through fragmentation, an attacker could likewise evade a firewall's controls through fragmentation. Once again, if the firewall does not reassemble these packets before delivery to the destination host, the attacker's enumeration attempt might succeed.
    
3. `Firewall/IPS/IDS Resource Exhaustion` - Suppose an attacker were to craft their attack to fragment packets to a very small MTU (10, 15, 20, and so on), the network control might not reassemble these packets due to resource constraints, and the attacker might succeed in their enumeration efforts.
    
4. `Denial of Service` - For old hosts, an attacker might utilize fragmentation to send IP packets exceeding 65535 bytes through ping or other commands. In doing so, the destination host will reassemble this malicious packet and experience countless different issues. As such, the resultant condition is successful denial-of-service from the attacker.


If our network mechanism were to perform correctly. It should do the following:

- `Delayed Reassembly` - The IDS/IPS/Firewall should act the same as the destination host, in the sense that it waits for all fragments to arrive to reconstruct the transmission to perform packet inspection.


#### Identifying Irregularities 

Seeing a ton of fragmentation from a host can be an indicator of this attack, and it would look like the following.
