There are many cases where we might see irregular traffic for IPv4 and IPv6 packets. In many such cases, this might be done through the source and destination IP fields. We should always consider the following when analysing these fields for our traffic analysis efforts.

1. `The Source IP Address should always be from our subnet` - If we notice that an incoming packet has an IP source from outside of our local area network, this can be an indicator of packet crafting.
2. `The Source IP for outgoing traffic should always be from our subnet` - If the source IP is from a different IP range than our own local area network, this can be an indicator of malicious traffic that is originating from inside our network.

An attacker might conduct these packet crafting attacks towards the source and destination IP addresses for many different reasons or desired outcomes. Here are a few that we can look for:

1. [[Decoy Scanning]] - Bypass Firewalls
2. [[Random Source Attack DDoS]] - Resource Exhaustion 
3. [[LAND Attacks]] - Resource Exhaustion 
4. [[SMURF Attacks]] - Resource Exhaustion 
5. [[Initialization Vector Generation]] - Statistical Attack for older networks
