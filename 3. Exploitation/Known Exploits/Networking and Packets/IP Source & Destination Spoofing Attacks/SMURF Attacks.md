Similar to [[LAND Attacks]] and [[Random Source Attack DDoS]], SMURF attacks work through the attacker sending large amounts of ICMP packets to many different hosts. However, in this case the source address is set to the victim machines, and all of the hosts which receive this ICMP packet respond with an ICMP reply causing resource exhaustion on the crafted source address (victim).

SMURF Attacks are a notable distributed denial-of-service attack, in the nature that they operate through causing random hosts to ping the victim host back. Simply put, an attacker conducts these like the following:

1. `The attacker will send an ICMP request to live hosts with a spoofed address of the victim host`
    
2. `The live hosts will respond to the legitimate victim host with an ICMP reply`
    
3. `This may cause resource exhaustion on the victim host`
