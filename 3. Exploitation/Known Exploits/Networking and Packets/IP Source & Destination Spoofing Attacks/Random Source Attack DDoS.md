Through random source crafting an attacker might be able to send tons of traffic to the same port on the victim host. This in many cases, is used to exhaust resources of our network controls or on the destination host.

Ping victim from many hosts which do not exist. The victim then pings back and causes DDoS.

In this case, we have a few indicators of nefarious behavior:

1. `Single Port Utilization from random hosts`
2. `Incremental Base Port with a lack of randomization`
3. `Identical Length Fields`
