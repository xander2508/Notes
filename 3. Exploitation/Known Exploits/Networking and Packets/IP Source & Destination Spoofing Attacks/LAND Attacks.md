LAND Attacks operate similarly to [[Random Source Attack DDoS]] attacks in the nature that the source address is set to the same as the destination hosts. In doing so the attacker might be able to exhaust network resources or cause crashes on the target host.

LAND attacks operate through an attacker spoofing the source IP address to be the same as the destination. These denial-of-service attacks work through sheer volume of traffic and port re-use. Essentially, if all base ports are occupied, it makes real connections much more difficult to establish to our affected host.
