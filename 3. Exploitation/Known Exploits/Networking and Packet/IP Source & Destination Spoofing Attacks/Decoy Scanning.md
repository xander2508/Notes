In an attempt to bypass firewall restrictions, an attacker might change the source IP of packets to enumerate further information about a host in another network segment. Through changing the source to something within the same subnet as the target host, the attacker might succeed in firewall evasion.

Simply put, when an attacker wants to gather information, they might change their source address to be the same as another legitimate host, or in some cases entirely different from any real host. This is to attempt to evade IDS/Firewall controls, and it can be easily observed.
