There are many cases where we might see irregular traffic for IPv4 and IPv6 packets. In many such cases, this might be done through the source and destination IP fields. We should always consider the following when analysing these fields for our traffic analysis efforts.

1. `The Source IP Address should always be from our subnet` - If we notice that an incoming packet has an IP source from outside of our local area network, this can be an indicator of packet crafting.
2. `The Source IP for outgoing traffic should always be from our subnet` - If the source IP is from a different IP range than our own local area network, this can be an indicator of malicious traffic that is originating from inside our network.

An attacker might conduct these packet crafting attacks towards the source and destination IP addresses for many different reasons or desired outcomes. Here are a few that we can look for:


1. [[Decoy Scanning]]
2. [[Random Source Attack DDoS]]
3. [[LAND Attacks]] 
4. [[SMURF Attacks]] - Similar to LAND and Random Source attacks, SMURF attacks work through the attacker sending large amounts of ICMP packets to many different hosts. However, in this case the source address is set to the victim machines, and all of the hosts which receive this ICMP packet respond with an ICMP reply causing resource exhaustion on the crafted source address (victim).
    
5. `Initialization Vector Generation` - In older wireless networks such as wired equivalent privacy, an attacker might capture, decrypt, craft, and re-inject a packet with a modified source and destination IP address in order to generate initialization vectors to build a decryption table for a statistical attack. These can be seen in nature by noticing an excessive amount of repeated packets between hosts.
