MS17-010 is an exploit leaked in the Shadow Brokers dump from the NSA. This exploit was most notably used in the WannaCry ransomware and NotPetya cyber attacks. This attack took advantage of a flaw in the SMB v1 protocol allowing for code execution. EternalBlue is believed to have infected upwards of 200,000 hosts just in 2017 and is still a common way to find access into a vulnerable Windows host.
