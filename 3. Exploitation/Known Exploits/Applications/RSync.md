See [[5. Standard Information/Operating Systems/Linux/Tooling/Backup and Restore/Rsync|Rsync]] for a usage guide

This [guide](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/873-pentesting-rsync) covers some of the ways Rsync can be abused, most notably by listing the contents of a shared folder on a target server and retrieving files. This can sometimes be done without authentication. Other times we will need credentials. If you find credentials during a pentest and run into Rsync on an internal (or external) host, it is always worth checking for password re-use as you may be able to pull down some sensitive files that could be used to gain remote access to the target.
