Linux Containers (`LXC`) is a virtualization technology that allows multiple isolated Linux systems to run on a single host. It uses resource isolation features, such as `cgroups` and `namespaces`, to provide a lightweight virtualization solution. LXC also provides a rich set of tools and APIs for managing and configuring containers, contributing to its popularity as a containerization technology. By combining the advantages of LXC with the power of Docker, users can achieve a fully-fledged containerization experience in Linux systems.

Once LXC is installed, we can start creating and managing containers on the Linux host. It is worth noting that LXC requires the Linux kernel to support the necessary features for containerization. Most modern Linux kernels have built-in support for containerization, but some older kernels may require additional configuration or patching to enable support for LXC.

LXC use `namespaces` to provide an isolated environment for processes, networks, and file systems from the host system. Namespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that allows for creating isolated environments by providing an abstraction of system resources.
#### Creating an LXC Container

To create a new LXC container, we can use the `lxc-create` command followed by the container's name and the template to use. For example, to create a new Ubuntu container named `linuxcontainer`, we can use the following command:

```shell-session
sudo lxc-create -n linuxcontainer -t ubuntu
```

|Command|Description|
|---|---|
|`lxc-ls`|List all existing containers|
|`lxc-stop -n <container>`|Stop a running container.|
|`lxc-start -n <container>`|Start a stopped container.|
|`lxc-restart -n <container>`|Restart a running container.|
|`lxc-config -n <container name> -s storage`|Manage container storage|
|`lxc-config -n <container name> -s network`|Manage container network settings|
|`lxc-config -n <container name> -s security`|Manage container security settings|
|`lxc-attach -n <container>`|Connect to a container.|
|`lxc-attach -n <container> -f /path/to/share`|Connect to a container and share a specific directory or file.|
## Securing LXC

In order to configure `cgroups` for LXC and limit the CPU and memory, a container can create a new configuration file in the `/usr/share/lxc/config/<container name>.conf` directory with the name of our container.

```shell-session
sudo vim /usr/share/lxc/config/linuxcontainer.conf
```

In this configuration file, we can add the following lines to limit the CPU and memory the container can use.

```txt
lxc.cgroup.cpu.shares = 512
lxc.cgroup.memory.limit_in_bytes = 512M
```
