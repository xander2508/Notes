[III. Stealing AD Credentials Using Hostile Portal Attacks · s0lst1c3/eaphammer Wiki · GitHub](https://github.com/s0lst1c3/eaphammer/wiki/III.-Stealing-AD-Credentials-Using-Hostile-Portal-Attacks

Hostile Portal Attacks are a weaponization of the captive portals typically used to restrict access to open networks in environments such as hotels and coffee shops. Instead of redirecting HTTP traffic to a login page, as with a captive portal, the hostile portal redirects HTTP traffic to an SMB share located on the attacker's machine. The result is that after the victim is forced to associate with the attacker using a rogue access point attack, any HTTP traffic generated by the victim will cause the victim's device to attempt NTLM authentication with the attacker. This is, in essence, an assisted [Redirect To SMB](https://github.com/s0lst1c3/eaphammer/wiki/redirect-to-smb.html) attack. The attacker also performs LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning against the victim.
