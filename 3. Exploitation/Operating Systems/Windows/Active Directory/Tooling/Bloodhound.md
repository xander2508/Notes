[BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound)

Used to visually map out AD relationships and help plan attack paths that may otherwise go unnoticed. Uses the SharpHound PowerShell or C# ingestor to gather data to later be imported into the BloodHound JavaScript (Electron) application with a Neo4j database for graphical analysis of the AD environment.

[BloodHound.py](https://github.com/fox-it/BloodHound.py)

A Python-based BloodHound ingestor based on the Impacket toolkit. It supports most BloodHound collection methods and can be run from a non-domain joined attack box. The output can be ingested into BloodHound 3.0 for analysis.
