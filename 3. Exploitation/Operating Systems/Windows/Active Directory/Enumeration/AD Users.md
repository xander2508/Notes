When starting enumeration in an AD environment, arguably, the most important objects are domain users. Users have access to computers and are assigned permissions to perform a variety of functions throughout the domain. We need to control user accounts to move laterally and vertically within a network to reach the assessment goal.

We can use [[PowerView SharpView]]  to enumerate a wealth of information about AD users. We can start by getting a count of how many users are in the target domain.

```powershell-session
(Get-DomainUser).count
```

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Identity harry.jones -Domain inlanefreight.local | Select-Object -Property name,samaccountname,description,memberof,whencreated,pwdlastset,lastlogontimestamp,accountexpires,admincount,userprincipalname,serviceprincipalname,mail,useraccountcontrol
```

It is useful to enumerate these properties for ALL domain users and export them to a CSV file for offline processing.

```powershell-session
Get-DomainUser * -Domain inlanefreight.local | Select-Object -Property name,samaccountname,description,memberof,whencreated,pwdlastset,lastlogontimestamp,accountexpires,admincount,userprincipalname,serviceprincipalname,mail,useraccountcontrol | Export-Csv .\inlanefreight_users.csv -NoTypeInformation
```

Once we have gathered information on all users, we can begin to perform more specific user enumeration by obtaining a list of users that do not require Kerberos pre-authentication and can be subjected to an ASREPRoast attack.

```powershell-session
.\SharpView.exe Get-DomainUser -KerberosPreauthNotRequired -Properties samaccountname,useraccountcontrol,memberof
```

Let's also gather information about users with Kerberos constrained delegation.

```powershell-session
.\SharpView.exe Get-DomainUser -TrustedToAuth -Properties samaccountname,useraccountcontrol,memberof
```

While we're at it, we can look for users that allow unconstrained delegation.

```powershell-session
.\SharpView.exe Get-DomainUser -LDAPFilter "(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288)"
```

We can also check for any domain users with sensitive data such as a password stored in the description field.

```powershell-session
Get-DomainUser -Properties samaccountname,description | Where {$_.description -ne $null}
```
