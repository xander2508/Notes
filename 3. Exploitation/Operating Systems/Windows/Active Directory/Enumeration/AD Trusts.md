Aside from using built-in AD tools such as the Active Directory PowerShell module, [[PowerView SharpView]] and [[BloodHound]] can be utilized to enumerate trust relationships, the type of trusts established, as well as the authentication flow.

`PowerView` can be used to perform a domain trust mapping and provide information such as the type of trust (parent/child, external, forest), as well as the direction of the trust (one-way or bidirectional). All of this information is extremely useful once a foothold is obtained, and you are planning to compromise the environment further.

We can use the function `Get-DomainTrust` to quickly check which trusts exist, the type, and the direction of the trusts.

```powershell-session
Get-DomainTrust
```
