Aside from using built-in AD tools such as the Active Directory PowerShell module, [[PowerView SharpView]] and [[BloodHound]] can be utilized to enumerate trust relationships, the type of trusts established, as well as the authentication flow.

`PowerView` can be used to perform a domain trust mapping and provide information such as the type of trust (parent/child, external, forest), as well as the direction of the trust (one-way or bidirectional). All of this information is extremely useful once a foothold is obtained, and you are planning to compromise the environment further.

We can use the function `Get-DomainTrust` to quickly check which trusts exist, the type, and the direction of the trusts.

```powershell-session
Get-DomainTrust
```

We can use the function `Get-DomainTrustMapping` to enumerate all trusts for our current domain and other reachable domains.

```powershell-session
Get-DomainTrustMapping
```

Depending on the trust type, there are several attacks that we may be able to perform, such as the `ExtraSids` attack to compromise a parent domain once the child domain has been compromised or cross-forest trust attacks such as `Kerberoasting` and `ASREPRoasting` and `SID History` abuse.
