### SID history 

The `SID history` attribute is used in migration scenarios. If a user in one domain is migrated to another domain, a new account is created in the second domain. The original user's SID will be added to the new user's SID history attribute, ensuring that they can still access resources in the original domain.

`SID history` is intended to work across domains but can actually work in the same domain. Using `Mimikatz`, it is possible to perform SID history injection and add an administrator account to the SID History attribute of an account that they control. When logging in with this account, all of the SIDs associated with the account are added to the user's token.

This token is used to determine what resources the account can access. If the SID of a Domain Admin account is added to the SID History attribute of this account, this account will be able to perform DCSync and create golden tickets for further persistence.

This can also be abused across a forest trust. If a user is migrated from one forest to another and SID Filtering is not enabled, it becomes possible to add a SID from the other forest, and this SID will be added to the user's token when authenticating across the trust. If the SID of an account having administrative privileges in Forest A is added to the SID history attribute of an account in Forest B, assuming they can authenticate across the forest, this account will have administrative privileges when accessing resources in the partner forest.

### Password Reuse

Another common way to cross trust boundaries is by leveraging password re-use. Let's say we compromise the `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` forest and find a user account named `BSIMMONS_ADM` that also exists in the `freightlogistics.local` forest. There is a good chance that this administrator re-uses their password across environments. Also, it is always worth checking for foreign users/foreign group membership. We may find accounts belonging to administrative (or non-administrative) groups in Forest A that are actually part of Forest B and can be used to gain a foothold in the partner forest.
