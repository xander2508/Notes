This module performs the SMB Relay attacks originally discovered by `cDc` extended to many target protocols (SMB, MSSQL, LDAP, etc). It receives a list of targets and for every connection received it will choose the next target and try to relay the credentials. Also, if specified, it will first to try authenticate against the client connecting to us.

By default, `impacket-ntlmrelayx` will dump the SAM database, but we can execute commands by adding the option `-c` (e.g. run a command line reverse shell).

```shell-session
impacket-ntlmrelayx --no-http-server -smb2support -t 10.10.110.146
```
