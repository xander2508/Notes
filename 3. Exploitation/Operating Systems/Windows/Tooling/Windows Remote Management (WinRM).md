[WinRM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal)Â Is an implementation of the WS-Management protocol. It can be used to manage the hardware and software functionalities of hosts. It is mainly used in IT administration but can also be used for host enumeration and as a scripting engine.

IT admins should take further steps to harden basic WinRM configurations, especially if the system will be remotely accessible over the Internet. Among some of these hardening options are:

- Configure TrustedHosts to include just IP addresses/hostnames that will be used for remote management
- Configure HTTPS for transport
- Join Windows systems to an Active Directory Domain Environment and Enforce Kerberos Authentication
