# Comprehensive Notes on Android Debuggable Applications and the `run-as` Utility

## Overview

This document covers the risks associated with debuggable Android applications, the misuse of the `run-as` utility, and the exploitation of CVE-2024-0044. It also provides detailed steps for mitigation and secure development practices.

## The `run-as` Utility: A Security Perspective

### What is `run-as`?

- A tool in the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) suite that allows users to execute commands as a specific application's user.
- Operates within the SE Linux policy framework with the `run-as_exec` context.

### Primary Functions

- Access and manipulate the private data directory of a target app.
- Execute commands with the target app’s user and group IDs (UID and GID).
- Read sensitive data, alter app configurations, or inject malicious files.

### How It Works

1. **Privilege Check**: Confirms the invoker is an ADB shell user or has equivalent privileges.
2. **Package Verification**: Ensures the target application is marked as debuggable in its manifest file.
3. **Environment Sanitization**: Clears environment variables like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to prevent tampering.
4. **Execution**: Switches UID and GID to the target app and executes commands in the same context.

## Debuggable Android Applications

### The `android:debuggable` Flag

- A setting in the app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
- Determines whether debugging features are enabled for the app.

### Default Behavior

- **Release Builds**: `android:debuggable` is set to `false`.
- **Debug Builds**: Gradle automatically sets it to `true` for easier testing.

### Common Misconfigurations

1. **Unintentional Debug Flag**:
    - Developers forget to set the flag to `false` for production builds.
    - Debug keys used instead of release keys.
2. **Debug Flag on Release Builds**:
    - Occurs when build processes are misconfigured.
    - Results in apps being exploitable even in production.

### Risks

1. **Sandbox Bypass**:
    - Android's sandboxing ensures app data isolation by assigning unique UIDs.
    - A debuggable app allows attackers to use `run-as` to access sensitive data in the sandbox.
2. **Exposure of Sensitive Data**:
    - Attackers can read databases, configuration files, and logs.
    - Potential to extract user credentials or financial information.
3. **Privilege Escalation**:
    - Altered app configurations can result in unintended behavior or elevated privileges.

## CVE-2024-0044: Exploiting the Android Package Installer Service

### Description

- A critical vulnerability in the `createSessionInternal` method of the Android Package Installer Service.
- Originates from missing input validation in the `installer package name`.

### Exploitation Process

1. **Craft Malicious Installer Names**:
    - Use the `adb shell pm install -i` command with unsanitized input.
    - Examples include injecting special characters or using invalid names.
2. **Insert Invalid Entries**:
    - Modify `packages.list` to include debuggable flags for target apps.
    - Escalate privileges using `run-as`.

### Implications

1. **Sandbox Breach**:
    - Gain unauthorized access to the application sandbox.
    - View, modify, or delete sensitive data.
2. **Privileged App Exploitation**:
    - Use bypass techniques to manipulate data from system-level apps like Contacts or Calendar.

---

## Practical Exploitation Steps

### For Non-System Applications

1. **Identify Target Application**:
    - Use `adb shell pm list packages` to find installed apps.
2. **Verify Debuggable Status**:
    - Use `aapt dump badging [apk_path]` to confirm if `debuggable` is set to `true`.
3. **Execute `run-as`**:
    - Use `adb shell run-as [package_name]` to access the app’s sandbox.

### For Privileged Applications

1. **Challenges**:
    - SE Linux policies restrict direct access to privileged apps.
2. **Solution**:
    - Use `/data/user/0` as a safe symlink to bypass UID validation in the `run-as` code.
    - Modify entries in `packages.list` using custom inputs like newline characters to manipulate app properties.

## Security Best Practices

### Avoid Debuggable Builds

1. **Manifest Configuration**:
    - Ensure `android:debuggable="false"` for all production builds.
    - Automate checks during the CI/CD pipeline to catch misconfigurations.
2. **Build Management**:
    - Use release keys for signing production builds.
    - Avoid using debug keys in any release process.

### Enforce Input Validation

1. **Package Names**:
    - Sanitize all installer package names in the `pm install` command.
    - Reject entries with special characters or suspicious patterns.
2. **Validation Across Layers**:
    - Apply strict checks in package manager services and AOSP implementations.

### SE Linux Policy Hardening

1. **Restrict `run-as` Utility**:
    - Ensure it cannot access privileged apps.
    - Audit policies to block unsafe symlink usage.
2. **Improve Context Definitions**:
    - Strengthen rules for privileged contexts like `run-as_exec`.

### Secure Development Practices

1. **Code Audits**:
    - Conduct regular reviews to identify vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-0044.
    - Implement automated tools for static and dynamic analysis.
2. **Testing**:
    - Perform penetration testing for app builds before release.
    - Simulate scenarios like data breaches using tools like `run-as`.

### Educate Development Teams

- Conduct training on:
    - Secure use of the `android:debuggable` flag.
    - Proper handling of sandboxing mechanisms.
    - Mitigation techniques for vulnerabilities.

## Advanced Exploitation Examples

### Reading Sensitive Data

- Use `run-as [package_name]` followed by commands like `cat` to extract data files:
    
    bash
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `adb shell run-as com.example.app cat /data/data/com.example.app/databases/userdata.db`
    

### Injecting Malicious Data

- Overwrite configuration files to alter app behavior:
    
    bash
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `adb shell run-as com.example.app echo "modified_value" > /data/data/com.example.app/shared_prefs/config.xml`
    

### Privileged Application Example

- Access the Contacts app’s database:
    
    bash
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `adb shell run-as com.android.providers.contacts sqlite3 /data/data/com.android.providers.contacts/databases/contacts2.db`
    
    Extract sensitive information like contact numbers and emails.
