[GitHub - Hackplayers/evil-winrm: The ultimate WinRM shell for hacking/pentesting](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm)

## Installation

```shell-session
sudo gem install evil-winrm
```

## Usage 

```shell-session
evil-winrm -i <target-IP> -u <username> -p <password>
```

```
evil-winrm -i love.htb -u quas4r -p quas4r@123
```

#### Kerberos

To use [evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm) with Kerberos, we need to install the Kerberos package used for network authentication. For some Linux like Debian-based (Parrot, Kali, etc.), it is called `krb5-user`.

```shell-session
sudo apt-get install krb5-user -y
```

In case the package `krb5-user` is already installed, we need to change the configuration file `/etc/krb5.conf` to include the following values:

```shell-session
cat /etc/krb5.conf

[libdefaults]
        default_realm = INLANEFREIGHT.HTB

<SNIP>

[realms]
    INLANEFREIGHT.HTB = {
        kdc = dc01.inlanefreight.htb
    }

<SNIP>
```
