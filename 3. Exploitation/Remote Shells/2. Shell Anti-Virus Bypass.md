## Archives

Archiving a piece of information such as a file, folder, script, executable, picture, or document and placing a password on the archive bypasses a lot of common anti-virus signatures today. However, the downside of this process is that they will be raised as notifications in the AV alarm dashboard as being unable to be scanned due to being locked with a password. An administrator can choose to manually inspect these archives to determine if they are malicious or not.
