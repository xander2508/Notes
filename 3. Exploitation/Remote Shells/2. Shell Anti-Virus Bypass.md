# Guide

1. See [[MSFVenom#Anti-Virus Bypass]] for reverse shells which bypass anti-virus
2. [Bypass Application Whitelisting using msbuild.exe (Multiple Methods)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bypass-application-whitelisting-using-msbuildexe-multiple-aarti-singh)

# Tools

1. [GitHub - oddcod3/Phantom-Evasion: Python antivirus evasion tool](https://github.com/oddcod3/Phantom-Evasion)
2. [Shellter | AV Evasion Artware](https://www.shellterproject.com/)
3.  `msf-virustotal`, providing a Virus Total API key, a payload can be analysed to see if it would be detected.

```shell-session
msf-virustotal -k <API key> -f TeamViewerInstall.exe
```

## Archives

Archiving a piece of information such as a file, folder, script, executable, picture, or document and placing a password on the archive bypasses a lot of common anti-virus signatures today. However, the downside of this process is that they will be raised as notifications in the AV alarm dashboard as being unable to be scanned due to being locked with a password. An administrator can choose to manually inspect these archives to determine if they are malicious or not.

## Packers

The term `Packer` refers to the result of an `executable compression` process where the payload is packed together with an executable program and with the decompression code in one single file. When run, the decompression code returns the backdoored executable to its original state, allowing for yet another layer of protection against file scanning mechanisms on target hosts. This process takes place transparently for the compressed executable to be run the same way as the original executable while retaining all of the original functionality. In addition, msfvenom provides the ability to compress and change the file structure of a backdoored executable and encrypt the underlying process structure.
