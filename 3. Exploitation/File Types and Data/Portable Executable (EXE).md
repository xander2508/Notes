Windows operating systems employ the `Portable Executable (PE)` format to encapsulate executable programs, `DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries)`, and other integral system components.

PE files accommodate a wide variety of data types including `executables (.exe)`, `dynamic link libraries (.dll)`, `kernel modules (.srv)`, `control panel applications (.cpl)`, and many more. The PE file format is fundamentally a data structure containing the vital information required for the Windows OS loader to manage the executable code, effectively loading it into memory.

### PE Sections

The PE Structure also houses a `Section Table`, an element comprising several sections dedicated to distinct purposes. The sections are essentially the repositories where the actual content of the file, including the data, resources utilized by the program, and the executable code, is stored. The `.text` section is often under scrutiny for potential artifacts related to injection attacks.

Common PE sections include:

- `Text Section (.text)`: The hub where the executable code of the program resides.
- `Data Section (.data)`: A storage for initialized global and static data variables.
- `Read-only initialized data (.rdata)`: Houses read-only data such as constant values, string literals, and initialized global and static variables.
- `Exception information (.pdata)`: A collection of function table entries utilized for exception handling.
- `BSS Section (.bss)`: Holds uninitialized global and static data variables.
- `Resource Section (.rsrc)`: Safeguards resources such as images, icons, strings, and version information.
- `Import Section (.idata)`: Details about functions imported from other DLLs.
- `Export Section (.edata)`: Information about functions exported by the executable.
- `Relocation Section (.reloc)`: Details for relocating the executable's code and data when loaded at a different memory address.

We can visualize the sections of a portable executable using a tool like `pestudio` as demonstrated below.
