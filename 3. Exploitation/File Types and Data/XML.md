# XML External Entity XXE Injection

XML External Entity (XXE) injection is a type of attack where an attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in an XML parser to disclose confidential data, execute remote code, or perform other malicious actions. This attack occurs when the XML input contains references to external entities that are processed by the XML parser.
