## Import Hashing (IMPHASH)

`IMPHASH`, an abbreviation for "Import Hash", is a cryptographic hash calculated from the import functions of a Windows Portable Executable (PE) file. Its algorithm functions by first converting all imported function names to lowercase. Following this, the DLL names and function names are fused together and arranged in alphabetical order. Finally, an MD5 hash is generated from the resulting string. 
Therefore, two PE files with identical import functions, in the same sequence, will share an `IMPHASH` value.
