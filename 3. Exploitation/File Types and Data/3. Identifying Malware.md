# String Analysis

Occasionally, we can unearth unique embedded strings in a malware sample, such as:

- Embedded filenames (e.g., dropped files)
- IP addresses or domain names
- Registry paths or keys
- Windows API functions
- Command-line arguments
- Unique information that might hint at a particular threat actor 

## Manual Analysis

The Linux `strings` command can be deployed to display the strings contained within a malware. `-n` specifies to print a sequence of at least the number specified.

```shell-session
strings -n 15
```

## FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver (FLOSS)

It's designed to supplement the use of traditional string tools, like the strings command in Unix-based systems, which can miss obfuscated strings that are commonly used by malware to evade detection.

```shell-session
floss malware.exe
```


# Unpacking UPX-packed Malware

In our static analysis, we might stumble upon a malware sample that's been compressed or obfuscated using a technique referred to as packing. Packing serves several purposes:

- It obfuscates the code, making it more challenging to discern its structure or functionality.
- It reduces the size of the executable, making it quicker to transfer or less conspicuous.
- It confounds security researchers by hindering traditional reverse engineering attempts.
