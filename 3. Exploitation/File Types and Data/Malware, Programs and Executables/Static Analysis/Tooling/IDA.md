The `Load a new file` dialog box that pops up next is where we can select the processor architecture. Choose the correct one and click `OK`. By default, `IDA` determines the appropriate processor type.

The default view is the `Graph view`, which provides a graphic illustration of the function's basic blocks and their interconnections. Basic blocks are instruction sequences with a single entry and exit point. These basic blocks are symbolized as nodes in the graph view, with the connections between them as edges.

To toggle between the graph and text views, simply press the `spacebar` button.

- The `Graph view` offers a pictorial representation of the program's control flow, facilitating a better understanding of execution flow, identification of loops, conditionals, and jumps, and a visualization of how the program branches or cycles through different code paths.
  
  The functions are displayed as `nodes` in the `Graph view`. Each function is depicted as a distinct node with a unique identifier and additional details such as the `function name`, `address`, and `size`.

- The `Text view` displays the assembly instructions along with their corresponding memory addresses. Each line in the `Text view` represents an `instruction or a data element` in the code, beginning with the `section name:virtual address` format (for example, `.text:00000000004014F0`, where the section name is `.text` and the virtual address is `00000000004014F0`).

## Text View 

`IDA`'s `Text view` employs arrows to signify different types of control flow instructions and jumps. Here are some commonly seen arrows and their interpretations:

- `Solid Arrow (→)`: A solid arrow denotes a direct jump or branch instruction, indicating an unconditional shift in the program's flow where execution moves from one location to another. This occurs when a jump or branch instruction like `jmp` or `call` is encountered.
- `Dashed Arrow (---→)`: A dashed arrow represents a conditional jump or branch instruction, suggesting that the program's flow might change based on a specific condition. The destination of the jump depends on the condition's outcome. For instance, a `jz` (jump if zero) instruction will trigger a jump only if a previous comparison yielded a zero value.

## Graph View

To enter a function in `IDA`'s disassembly view, place the cursor on the instruction that represents the function call (or jump instruction) we want to follow, then right-click on the instruction and select `Jump to Operand` from the context menu. Alternatively, we can press the `Enter` key on our keyboard.
