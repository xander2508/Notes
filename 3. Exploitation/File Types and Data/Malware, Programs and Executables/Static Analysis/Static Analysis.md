Through static analysis, we endeavour to extract pivotal information which includes:

- File type
- File hash
- Strings
- Embedded elements
- Packer information
- Imports
- Exports
- Assembly code
## Identifying the File Type

See [[3. Exploitation/File Types and Data/1. Guide|Guide]]

## Disassembly

A `Disassembler` is our tool of choice when we wish to conduct a static analysis of the code, meaning that we need not execute the code. This type of analysis is invaluable as it helps us to understand the structure and logic of the code without activating potentially harmful functionalities. Some prime examples of disassemblers include `IDA`, `Cutter`, and `Ghidra`.
