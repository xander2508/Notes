[FakeDNS | Project X](https://xtls.github.io/en/config/fakedns.html)

FakeDNS is used to obtain target domain names by forging DNS, which can reduce the delay in DNS queries and work with transparent proxies to obtain target domain names.

> [!NOTE]
> FakeDNS may contaminate the local DNS and cause "network unreachable" after Xray is closed.
