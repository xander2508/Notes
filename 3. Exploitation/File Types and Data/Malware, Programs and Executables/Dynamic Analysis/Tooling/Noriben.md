[Noriben](https://github.com/Rurik/Noriben) is a powerful tool in our dynamic analysis toolkit, essentially acting as a Python wrapper for Sysinternals `ProcMon`, a comprehensive system monitoring utility. It orchestrates the operation of `ProcMon`, refines the output, and adds a layer of malware-specific intelligence to the process. Leveraging `Noriben`, we can capture malware behaviours more conveniently and understand them more precisely.

We can leverage [[YARA]] rules to enhance our data filtering capabilities, allowing us to identify patterns of interest more efficiently.

```cmd-session
python .\Noriben.py
```

In the Command Prompt running Noriben, use the `Ctrl+C` command to cease its operation.
