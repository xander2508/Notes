# Guide

1. Creating CRT files: 
	[Hack The Box - LaCasaDePapel - 0xRick’s Blog](https://0xrick.github.io/hack-the-box/lacasadepapel/)
	```
	openssl req -new -key ca.key -out server.csr  
	openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey ca.key -out server.crt  
	openssl pkcs12 -export -in server.crt -inkey ca.key -out server.p12
	```

```shell-session
openssl req -x509 -out server.pem -keyout server.pem -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -subj '/CN=server'
```

This source is [Certificate Transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency) logs, see [[Certificate Transparency Logs]]

The standard ([RFC 6962](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962)) provides for the logging of all digital certificates issued by a certificate authority in audit-proof logs. This is intended to enable the detection of false or maliciously issued certificates for a domain. SSL certificate providers like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) share this with the web interface [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/), which stores the new entries in the database to be accessed later.

`Certificate Transparency` (`CT`) logs are public, append-only ledgers that record the issuance of SSL/TLS certificates. Whenever a Certificate Authority (CA) issues a new certificate, it must submit it to multiple CT logs. Independent organisations maintain these logs and are open for anyone to inspect.

Think of CT logs as a `global registry of certificates`. They provide a transparent and verifiable record of every SSL/TLS certificate issued for a website. 
### Usage 

```shell-session
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq .
```

Sub-Domains 

```shell-session
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq . | grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | cut -d'"' -f2 | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;' | sort -u
```
