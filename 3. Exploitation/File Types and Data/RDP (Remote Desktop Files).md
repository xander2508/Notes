RDP files are saved connection profiles that contain information such as the computer name or IP address, username, and encryption settings. These files can be easily transferred between computers, allowing for quick access to remote systems.

By simply double-clicking on an RDP file, users can launch a Remote Desktop Connection session and connect to a remote computer without having to manually enter all the connection details. This saves time and reduces the chance of errors.

RDP files also allow for customization of connection settings, such as display resolution, local resource sharing options, and authentication methods. This flexibility makes it easier to tailor each connection to specific needs.
