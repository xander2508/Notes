## Bitlocker Encrypted Drives

[BitLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-device-encryption-overview-windows-10) is an encryption program for entire partitions and external drives. Microsoft developed it for the Windows operating system. It has been available since Windows Vista and uses the `AES` encryption algorithm with 128-bit or 256-bit length. If the password or PIN for BitLocker is forgotten, we can use the recovery key to decrypt the partition or drive. The recovery key is a 48-digit string of numbers generated during BitLocker setup that also can be brute-forced.

```shell-session
bitlocker2john -i Backup.vhd > backup.hashes
```

```shell-session
grep "bitlocker\$0" backup.hashes > backup.hash
```

See [[Hashcat]] and [[John the Ripper|John]]

```shell-session
hashcat -m 22100 backup.hash /opt/useful/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt -o backup.cracked
```
