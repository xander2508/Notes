The `*.ps1` file extension represents executable PowerShell scripts.

[PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.1) is both a shell environment and scripting language. It serves as Microsoft's modern shell environment in their operating systems. As a scripting language, it is a dynamic language based on the .NET Common Language Runtime that, like its shell component, takes input and output as .NET objects. PowerShell can provide us with a plethora of options when it comes to gaining a shell and execution on a host, among many other steps in our penetration testing process.
