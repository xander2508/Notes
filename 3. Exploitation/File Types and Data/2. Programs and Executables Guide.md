1. Examine the contents, see [[#Examining the Contents]]
2. If the executable is complicated and makes a lot of calls, `ltrace` and `strace`, can be used, see [HTB: Lazy | 0xdf hacks stuff](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2020/07/29/htb-lazy.html#priv-mitsos--root) and [[#lTrace]]
3. Use [[Ghidra]] to inspect the code for hidden files


# lTrace

Run `STrace` on the file and search the output for open/access calls and for "no such file" errors:

```
strace /usr/local/bin/suid-so 2>&1 | grep -iE "open|access|no such file"
```

Can be used for a [[Path Hijacking]] exploit, see [HTB: Lazy | 0xdf hacks stuff](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2020/07/29/htb-lazy.html#priv-mitsos--root)
