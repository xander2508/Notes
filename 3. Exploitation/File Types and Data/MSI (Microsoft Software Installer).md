See [MSI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/windows-installer-file-extensions) 

`.MSI` files serve as an installation database for the Windows Installer. When attempting to install a new application, the installer will look for the `.msi` file to understand all of the components required and how to find them. 

We can use the Windows Installer by crafting a payload as an `.msi` file. Once we have it on the host, we can run `msiexec` to execute our file, which will provide us with further access, such as an elevated reverse shell.
