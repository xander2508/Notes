## Guide

YSOSerial.jar:
`wget https://jitpack.io/com/github/frohoff/ysoserial/master-SNAPSHOT/ysoserial-master-SNAPSHOT.jar -O ysoserial.jar`

This tool requires an important piece of information: a payload. See the walkthroughs above as the most time it will be blind. Hopefully in enumeration and recon a file or maybe Java Class.
