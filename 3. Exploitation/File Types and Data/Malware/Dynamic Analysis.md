When it comes to the domain of malware analysis, dynamic or behavioural analysis represents an indispensable approach in our investigative arsenal. In dynamic analysis, we observe and interpret the behaviour of the malware while it is running, or in action. This is a critical contrast to static analysis, where we dissect the malware's properties and contents without executing it. The primary goal of dynamic analysis is to document and understand the real-world impact of the malware on its host environment, making it an integral part of comprehensive malware analysis.

Our dynamic analysis procedure can be broken down into the following steps:

- `Environment Setup`: We first establish a secure and controlled environment, typically a `VM`, isolated from the rest of the network to prevent inadvertent contamination or propagation of the malware. The VM setup should mimic a real-world system, complete with software, applications, and network configurations that an actual user might have.
- `Baseline Capture`: After the environment is set up, we capture a snapshot of the system's clean state. This baseline serves as a reference point to identify changes made by the malware post-execution.
- `Tool Deployment (Pre-Execution)`: To capture the activities of the malware effectively, we deploy various monitoring and logging tools. Tools such as [[Process moniter]] from Sysinternals Suite are used to log system calls, file system activity, registry operations, etc. We can also employ utilities like `Wireshark`, `tcpdump`, and `Fiddler` for capturing network traffic, and `Regshot` to take before-and-after snapshots of the system registry. Finally, tools such as `INetSim`, `FakeDNS`, and `FakeNet-NG` are used to simulate internet services.
