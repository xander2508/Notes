[Noriben](https://github.com/Rurik/Noriben) is a powerful tool in our dynamic analysis toolkit, essentially acting as a Python wrapper for Sysinternals `ProcMon`, a comprehensive system monitoring utility. It orchestrates the operation of `ProcMon`, refines the output, and adds a layer of malware-specific intelligence to the process. Leveraging `Noriben`, we can capture malware behaviors more conveniently and understand them more precisely.
