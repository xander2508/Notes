[Noriben](https://github.com/Rurik/Noriben) is a powerful tool in our dynamic analysis toolkit, essentially acting as a Python wrapper for Sysinternals `ProcMon`, a comprehensive system monitoring utility. It orchestrates the operation of `ProcMon`, refines the output, and adds a layer of malware-specific intelligence to the process. Leveraging `Noriben`, we can capture malware behaviours more conveniently and understand them more precisely.

We can leverage YARA rules to enhance our data filtering capabilities, allowing us to identify patterns of interest more efficiently.
