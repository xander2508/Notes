Windows operating systems employ the `Portable Executable (PE)` format to encapsulate executable programs, `DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries)`, and other integral system components.

PE files accommodate a wide variety of data types including `executables (.exe)`, `dynamic link libraries (.dll)`, `kernel modules (.srv)`, `control panel applications (.cpl)`, and many more. The PE file format is fundamentally a data structure containing the vital information required for the Windows OS loader to manage the executable code, effectively loading it into memory.
