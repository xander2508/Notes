SHA256 is a cryptographic hash function that generates a fixed-size 256-bit (32-byte) hash value from any input data. It is widely used in various security applications, such as digital signatures, SSL certificates, and blockchain technology. SHA256 is considered to be highly secure and resistant to collision attacks, making it a popular choice for securing sensitive data.
