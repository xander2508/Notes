MD5 is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value. It is commonly used to verify data integrity and as a checksum to detect unintentional data corruption. MD5 is considered to be a fast algorithm and is often used in various security applications, such as digital signatures and password hashing. 
However, it is now considered to be vulnerable to collision attacks, which means that different inputs can produce the same hash value. As a result, MD5 is no longer recommended for secure encryption purposes.

# Tooling
