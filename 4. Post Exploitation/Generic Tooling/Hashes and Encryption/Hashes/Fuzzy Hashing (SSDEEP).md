`Fuzzy Hashing (SSDEEP)`, also referred to as context-triggered piecewise hashing (CTPH), is a hashing technique designed to compute a hash value indicative of content similarity between two files. This technique dissects a file into smaller, fixed-size blocks and calculates a hash for each block. The resulting hash values are then consolidated to generate the final fuzzy hash.

The `SSDEEP` algorithm allocates more weight to longer sequences of common blocks, making it highly effective in identifying files that have undergone minor modifications, or are similar but not identical, such as different variations of a malicious sample.
