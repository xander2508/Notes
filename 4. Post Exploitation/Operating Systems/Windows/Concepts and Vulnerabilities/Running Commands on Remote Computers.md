```powershell-session
invoke-command -ComputerName ACADEMY-ICL-DC,LOCALHOST -ScriptBlock {Get-Service -Name 'windefend'}
```

- `Invoke-Command`: We are telling PowerShell that we want to run a command on a local or remote computer.
- `Computername`: We provide a comma-defined list of computer names to query.
- `ScriptBlock {commands to run}`: This portion is the enclosed command we want to run on the computer. For it to run, we need it to be enclosed in {}.
