User accounts are a way for personnel to access and use a host's resources. In certain circumstances, the system will also utilize a specially provisioned user account to perform actions. When thinking about accounts, we typically run into four different types:

- Service Accounts
- Built-in accounts
- Local users
- Domain users

# Built-In Accounts

|**Account**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Administrator`|This account is used to accomplish administrative tasks on the local host.|
|`Default Account`|The default account is used by the system for running multi-user auth apps like the Xbox utility.|
|`Guest Account`|This account is a limited rights account that allows users without a normal user account to access the host. It is disabled by default and should stay that way.|
|`WDAGUtility Account`|This account is in place for the Defender Application Guard, which can sandbox application sessions.|

To see what groups the current user is part of use `whoami /groups`
