# Find 


```cmd-session
find /i "see" < test.txt
```

```cmd-session
find "password" "C:\Users\student\not-passwords.txt" 
```

The `/V` modifier can change our search from a matching clause to a `Not` clause. So, for example, if we use `/V` with the search string password against a file, it will show us any line that does not have the specified string. 

We can also use the `/N` switch to display line numbers for us and the `/I` display to ignore case sensitivity.

# FindStr
The `findstr` command is similar to `find` in that it searches through files but for patterns instead. It will look for anything matching a pattern, regex value, wildcards, and more. Think of it as find2.0. For those familiar with Linux, `findstr` is closer to `grep`.
