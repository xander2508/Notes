`Comp` will check each byte within two files looking for differences and then displays where they start. By default, the differences are shown in a decimal format. We can use the `/A` modifier if we want to see the differences in ASCII format. The `/L` modifier can also provide us with the line numbers.

```cmd-session
comp .\file-1.md .\file-2.md

Comparing .\file-1.md and .\file-2.md...
