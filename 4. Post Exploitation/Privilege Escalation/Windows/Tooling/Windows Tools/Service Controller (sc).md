[SC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc754599(v=ws.11)) is a Windows executable utility that allows us to query, modify, and manage host services locally and over the network. Other tools, like Windows Management Instrumentation (`WMIC`) and `Tasklist` that can also query and manage services for local and remote hosts.

The `sc qc` command is used to query the service. This is where knowing the names of services can come in handy. If we wanted to query a service on a device over the network, we could specify the hostname or IP address immediately after `sc`.

# Query All Active Services

```cmd-session
sc query type= service
```

# Query One Service 

```cmd-session
sc query windefend    
```

# Stopping and Starting Services

Certain processes are protected under stricter access requirements than what local administrator accounts have.

```cmd-session
sc stop wuauserv
```

```cmd-session
sc start wuauserv
```





```cmd-session
sc qc wuauserv
```

```cmd-session
sc //hostname or ip of box query ServiceName
```

We can also use sc to start and stop services.


Another helpful way we can examine service permissions using `sc` is through the `sdshow` command.

```cmd-session
sc sdshow wuauserv
