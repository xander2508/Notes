The `sc qc` command is used to query the service. This is where knowing the names of services can come in handy. If we wanted to query a service on a device over the network, we could specify the hostname or IP address immediately after `sc`.

```cmd-session
sc qc wuauserv
```

```cmd-session
sc //hostname or ip of box query ServiceName
```

We can also use sc to start and stop services.

```cmd-session
sc stop wuauserv
```

Another helpful way we can examine service permissions using `sc` is through the `sdshow` command.

```cmd-session
sc sdshow wuauserv
