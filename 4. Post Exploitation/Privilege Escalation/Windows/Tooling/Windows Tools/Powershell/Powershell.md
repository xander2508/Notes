`Get-Command` is a great way to find a pesky command that might be slipping from our memory right when we need to use it. With PowerShell using the `verb-noun` convention for cmdlets, we can search on either.

```powershell-session
 Get-Command -verb get
```

```powershell-session
Get-Command -noun windows*  
```

| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CTRL+R`           | It makes for a searchable history. We can start typing after, and it will show us results that match previous commands.                             |
| `CTRL+L`           | Quick screen clear.                                                                                                                                 |
| `CTRL+ALT+Shift+?` | This will print the entire list of keyboard shortcuts PowerShell will recognize.                                                                    |
| `Escape`           | When typing into the CLI, if you wish to clear the entire line, instead of holding backspace, you can just hit `escape`, which will erase the line. |
| `↑`                | Scroll up through our previous history.                                                                                                             |
| `↓`                | Scroll down through our previous history.                                                                                                           |
| `F7`               | Brings up a TUI with a scrollable interactive history from our session.                                                                             |

# Execution Policy

[about Execution Policies - PowerShell | Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.2)

As outlined in Microsoft's official documentation, an execution policy is not a security control. It is designed to give IT admins a tool to set parameters and safeguards for themselves.

```powershell-session
Get-ExecutionPolicy 
```

```powershell-session
Set-ExecutionPolicy undefined 
```
