# Commands 
`Get-Command` is a great way to find a pesky command that might be slipping from our memory right when we need to use it. With PowerShell using the `verb-noun` convention for cmdlets, we can search on either.

```powershell-session
 Get-Command -verb get
```

```powershell-session
Get-Command -noun windows*  
```
