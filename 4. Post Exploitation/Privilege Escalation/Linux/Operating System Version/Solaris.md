Solaris is widely used in enterprise environments for mission-critical applications, such as database management, cloud computing, and virtualization. For example, it includes a built-in hypervisor called `Oracle VM Server for SPARC`, which allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server. Overall, it is designed to handle large amounts of data and provide reliable and secure services to users and is often used in enterprise environments where security, performance, and stability are key requirements.

The goal of Solaris is to provide a highly stable, secure, and scalable platform for enterprise computing. It has built-in features for high availability, fault tolerance, and system management, making it ideal for mission-critical applications. It is widely used in the banking, finance, and government sectors, where security, reliability, and performance are paramount. It is also used in large-scale data centres, cloud computing environments, and virtualization platforms. Companies such as Amazon, IBM, and Dell use Solaris in their products and services, highlighting its importance in the industry.

Solaris uses a Service Management Facility (`SMF`), which is a highly advanced service management framework that provides better reliability and availability for system services.

In summary, the main differences can be grouped into the following categories:

- Filesystem
- Process management
- Package management
- Kernel and Hardware support
- System monitoring
- Security

# File System Hierarchy

|**Directory**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`/`|The root directory contains all other directories and files in the file system.|
|`/bin`|It contains essential system binaries that are required for booting and basic system operations.|
|`/boot`|The boot directory contains boot-related files such as boot loader and kernel images.|
|`/dev`|The dev directory contains device files that represent physical and logical devices attached to the system.|
|`/etc`|The etc directory contains system configuration files, such as system startup scripts and user authentication data.|
|`/home`|Users’ home directories.|
|`/kernel`|This directory contains kernel modules and other kernel-related files.|
|`/lib`|Directory for libraries required by the binaries in /bin and /sbin directories.|
|`/lost+found`|This directory is used by the file system consistency check and repair tool to store recovered files.|
|`/mnt`|Directory for mounting file systems temporarily.|
|`/opt`|This directory contains optional software packages that are installed on the system.|
|`/proc`|The proc directory provides a view into the system's process and kernel status as files.|
|`/sbin`|This directory contains system binaries required for system administration tasks.|
|`/tmp`|Temporary files created by the system and applications are stored in this directory.|
|`/usr`|The usr directory contains system-wide read-only data and programs, such as documentation, libraries, and executables.|
|`/var`|This directory contains variable data files, such as system logs, mail spools, and printer spools.|
