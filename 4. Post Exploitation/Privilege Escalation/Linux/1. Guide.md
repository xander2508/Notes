# Guide

1. Repeat below under every single privilege increase
2. Run [[#Default Commands]]
3. Use `uname -a` and research the specific Linux version for exploits, see [[4. Post Exploitation/Privilege Escalation/Linux/Operating System Version/1. Guide|Guide]] for previous operating system vulnerabilities
4. Check the permissions of the current user:
	1. Are they part of the `Wheel` group, see [[SUCrack]]
	2. Can they run `Sudo`? `sudo -l`
5. Check for any open ports, `netstat` and their associated applications
6. If strange applications are running as `root` 
# Table of Contents

1. If `su` or `sudo` is available, bruteforcing other users may be possible, see [[SUCrack]] 
2. If `VNC` is open on an internal port, see [[VNC Viewer]]
3. Any interesting processes or files, check using `getcap` and see [[Capabilities]]
4. If `ssh` is available internally, see [[SSH]]
