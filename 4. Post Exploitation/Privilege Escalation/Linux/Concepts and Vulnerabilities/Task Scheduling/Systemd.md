Systemd is a service used in Linux systems such as Ubuntu, Redhat Linux, and Solaris to start processes and scripts at a specific time. With it, we can set up processes and scripts to run at a specific time or time interval and can also specify specific events and triggers that will trigger a specific task. To do this, we need to take some steps and precautions before our scripts or processes are automatically executed by the system.

1. Create a timer
2. Create a service
3. Activate the timer
