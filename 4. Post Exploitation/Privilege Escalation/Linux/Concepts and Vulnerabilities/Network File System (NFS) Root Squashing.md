Read the _ **/etc/exports** _ file, if you find some directory that is configured as **no_root_squash**, then you can **access** it from **as a client** and **write inside** that directory **as** if you were the local **root** of the machine.

**no_root_squash**: This option basically gives authority to the root user on the client to access files on the NFS server as root. And this can lead to serious security implications.

**no_all_squash:** This is similar to **no_root_squash** option but applies to **non-root users**. Imagine, you have a shell as nobody user; checked /etc/exports file; no_all_squash option is present; check /etc/passwd file; emulate a non-root user; create a SUID file as that user (by mounting using NFS). Execute the SUID as nobody user and become different user.
