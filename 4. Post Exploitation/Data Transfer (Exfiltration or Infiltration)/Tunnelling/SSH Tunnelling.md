#Tunnelling

Setting up an SSH tunnel allows you to securely access a remote server through an encrypted connection.
SSH tunnelling is commonly used for accessing private networks, bypassing firewalls, and encrypting internet traffic.
Once the tunnel is established, you can access services on the remote server as if they were running locally on your machine.

# Chisel

Chisel is a fast TCP tunnel, transported over HTTP, secured via SSH. Single executable including both client and server. Written in Go (golang). Chisel is mainly useful for passing through firewalls, though it can also be used to provide a secure endpoint into your network. Chisel is very similar to crowbar though achieves much higher performance.
