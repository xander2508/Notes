# Identify Hashes

1. [HashID](https://www.kali.org/tools/hashid/)

# Notes

1. If the algorithm used for the hashing is known, see [[Magic Hashes]]
2. If the hash starts with `0e` or `uncrackable`, see [[Magic Hashes]]
3. Ensure the hashes are correctly capitalised.
4. If the password is prepended with a secret value, and the hash is available, see [Hash Length Extension Attack](https://blog.skullsecurity.org/2012/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hash-length-extension-attacks)

# Brute-Forcing Guide

1. Ensure all sources are crawled for credentials, see [[CEWL]]
2. If the password format is known, or the password is known to be common, see [[Hashcat#Rules Based Brute-Forcing|Hashcat]]

# Generating Hashes

```
#!/bin/bash
input="/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/500-worst-passwords.txt"
while IFS= read -r line
do
  echo -n "$line" | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}'  >> newhash
  echo -n "$line" | md5sum | awk '{print $1}'  >> newhash
  echo -n "$line" | sha1sum | awk '{print $1}'  >> newhash
done < "$input"

input="newhash"
while IFS= read -r line
do
  echo ${line^^} >> newhash2
done < "$input"
```
