`Section hashing`, (hashing PE sections) is a powerful technique that allows analysts to identify sections of a Portable Executable (PE) file that have been modified. This can be particularly useful for identifying minor variations in malware samples, a common tactic employed by attackers to evade detection.

By applying `section hashing`, security analysts can identify parts of a PE file that have been tampered with or altered. This can help identify similar malware samples, even if they have been slightly modified to evade traditional signature-based detection methods.

Remember that while `section hashing` is a powerful technique, it is not foolproof. Malware authors might employ tactics like section name obfuscation or dynamically generating section names to try and bypass this kind of analysis.
# Tooling 

```python
import sys
import pefile
pe_file = sys.argv[1]
pe = pefile.PE(pe_file)
for section in pe.sections:
    print (section.Name, "MD5 hash:", section.get_hash_md5())
    print (section.Name, "SHA256 hash:", section.get_hash_sha256())
```
