What is the first step of pentesting recon?

##### assistant
The first step of penetration testing (pentesting) reconnaissance, often referred to as "recon," is typically **information gathering**. This phase involves collecting as much data as possible about the target system, network, or organization. The goal is to understand the target's structure, technologies, and potential vulnerabilities.
Information gathering can be divided into two main categories:
1. **Passive Reconnaissance**: This involves collecting information without directly interacting with the target. Techniques include:
- **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)**: Using publicly available sources such as websites, social media, public records, and online databases.
- **DNS Queries**: Gathering information about domain names and their associated IP addresses.
- **WHOIS Lookups**: Retrieving registration details of domain names.
- **Google Dorking**: Using advanced search operators to find sensitive information indexed by search engines.
- **Social Engineering**: Gathering information through interactions with people, often without their knowledge that they are providing useful data.
2. **Active Reconnaissance**: This involves directly interacting with the target to gather information. Techniques include:
- **Network Scanning**: Using tools like Nmap to discover live hosts, open ports, and services running on the network.
- **Banner Grabbing**: Capturing service banners to identify software versions and configurations.
- **Ping Sweeps**: Sending ICMP requests to identify live hosts on a network.
- **Traceroute**: Mapping the path packets take to reach the target, which can reveal network topology and intermediate devices.
The information gathered during this initial reconnaissance phase is crucial for planning subsequent steps in the penetration testing process, such as vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and post-exploitation activities.

Based on your notes, it looks like you should use **Note 2** titled "Recon/Open Source Intelligence/1. Guide.md#Tools" for information on tools that can be used during the reconnaissance phase of pentesting. This note provides a list of OSINT tools that can help you gather information about your target without direct interaction. Here are some of the tools mentioned:

1. **Social Searcher** - A free social media search engine.
2. **twofi** - A tool to generate a wordlist using Twitter.
3. **linkedin2username** - A tool to generate username lists from companies on LinkedIn.
4. **theHarvester** - A tool for harvesting emails, subdomains, and names.

These tools will be useful for passive reconnaissance to gather valuable information about your target.
