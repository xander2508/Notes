The `X Display Manager Control Protocol` (`XDMCP`) protocol is used by the `X Display Manager` for communication through UDP port 177 between X terminals and computers operating under Unix/Linux. It is used to manage remote X Window sessions on other machines and is often used by Linux system administrators to provide access to remote desktops. XDMCP is an insecure protocol and should not be used in any environment that requires high levels of security. With this, it is possible to redirect an entire graphical user interface (`GUI`) (such as KDE or Gnome) to a corresponding client. For a Linux system to act as an XDMCP server, an X system with a GUI must be installed and configured on the server. After starting the computer, a graphical interface should be available locally to the user.

One potential way that XDMCP could be exploited is through a man-in-the-middle attack. In this type of attack, an attacker intercepts the communication between the remote computer and the X Window System server, and impersonates one of the parties in order to gain unauthorized access to the server. The attacker could then use the server to run arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, or perform other actions that could compromise the security of the system.
