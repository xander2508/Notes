[NetBios](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1001.txt)Â itself isn't directly a service or protocol but a connection and conversation mechanism widely used in networks. It was the original transport mechanism for SMB, but that has since changed. Now it serves as an alternate identification mechanism when DNS fails. Can also be known as NBT-NS (NetBIOS name service).
