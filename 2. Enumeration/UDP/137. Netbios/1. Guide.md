[NetBios](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1001.txt) itself isn't directly a service or protocol but a connection and conversation mechanism widely used in networks. It was the original transport mechanism for [[2. Enumeration/TCP/445. Server Message Block (SMB)/1. Guide|SMB]], but that has since changed. Now it serves as an alternate identification mechanism when DNS fails. Can also be known as NBT-NS (NetBIOS name service).

The NetBIOS API provided a blueprint for an application to connect and share data with other computers. In a [[2. Enumeration/UDP/137. Netbios/1. Guide|NetBios]] environment, when a machine goes online, it needs a name, which is done through the so-called `name registration` procedure. Either each host reserves its hostname on the network, or the [NetBIOS Name Server](https://networkencyclopedia.com/netbios-name-server-nbns/) (`NBNS`) is used for this purpose. It also has been enhanced to [Windows Internet Name Service](https://networkencyclopedia.com/windows-internet-name-service-wins/) (`WINS`).
