The `Oracle Transparent Network Substrate` (`TNS`) server is a communication protocol that facilitates communication between Oracle databases and applications over networks. Initially introduced as part of the [Oracle Net Services](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/netag/introducing-oracle-net-services.html) software suite, TNS supports various networking protocols between Oracle databases and client applications, such as `IPX/SPX` and `TCP/IP` protocol stacks. As a result, it has become a preferred solution for managing large, complex databases in the healthcare, finance, and retail industries. In addition, its built-in encryption mechanism ensures the security of data transmitted, making it an ideal solution for enterprise environments where data security is paramount.
