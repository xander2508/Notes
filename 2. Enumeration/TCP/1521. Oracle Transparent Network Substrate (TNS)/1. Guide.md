The `Oracle Transparent Network Substrate` (`TNS`) server is a communication protocol that facilitates communication between Oracle databases and applications over networks. Initially introduced as part of the [Oracle Net Services](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/netag/introducing-oracle-net-services.html) software suite, TNS supports various networking protocols between Oracle databases and client applications, such as `IPX/SPX` and `TCP/IP` protocol stacks. As a result, it has become a preferred solution for managing large, complex databases in the healthcare, finance, and retail industries. In addition, its built-in encryption mechanism ensures the security of data transmitted, making it an ideal solution for enterprise environments where data security is paramount.

## Walkthroughs

## SID Brute Forcing 

See [[2. Enumeration/TCP/1521. Oracle Transparent Network Substrate (TNS)/2. Information#System Identifiers|SID Information]]

```shell-session
sudo nmap -p1521 -sV 10.129.204.235 --open --script oracle-sid-brute
```

## Enumeration 

Those scans can retrieve database names, versions, running processes, user accounts, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, etc.

See [[Oracle Database Attacking Tool (ODAT)]]

```shell-session
./odat.py all -s 10.129.204.235
```

## Commands 

See [[SQLPlus]]

## Privilege Escalation

If a user is provided appropriate privileges typically granted by the database administer we can try using this account to log in as the System Database Admin (`sysdba`), giving us higher privileges.

```shell-session
sqlplus scott/tiger@10.129.204.235/XE as sysdba
```
