Telnet is a network protocol that allows a bidirectional interactive communication session between two devices over a network. This protocol was developed in the 1970s and was defined in [[Request for Comments (RFC)]] 854. As of recent years, its usage has decreased significantly as opposed to [[2. Enumeration/TCP/22. SSH/1. Guide|SSH]].

In many older cases, such as our Windows NT like machines, they may still utilize telnet to provide remote command and control to Microsoft terminal services.

However, we should always watch for weird and strange telnet communications as it can also be used by attackers for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration and tunnelling.

There is no restriction on which port Telnet uses. An attacker can change the port or even use IPv6, to fit their needs.
