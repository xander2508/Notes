[WinRM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal) Is an implementation of the WS-Management protocol. It can be used to manage the hardware and software functionalities of hosts. It is mainly used in IT administration but can also be used for host enumeration and as a scripting engine.

 [Windows Remote Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal) (`WinRM`) is the Microsoft implementation of the network protocol [Web Services Management Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/ws-management-protocol) (`WS-Management`). It is a network protocol based on XML web services using the [Simple Object Access Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/windows-remote-management-glossary) (`SOAP`) used for remote management of Windows systems. It takes care of the communication between [Web-Based Enterprise Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-Based_Enterprise_Management) (`WBEM`) and the [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-start-page) (`WMI`), which can call the [Distributed Component Object Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dcom/4a893f3d-bd29-48cd-9f43-d9777a4415b0) (`DCOM`). 
 
 WinRM uses the Simple Object Access Protocol (`SOAP`) to establish connections to remote hosts and their applications. Therefore, WinRM must be explicitly enabled and configured starting with Windows 10.

IT admins should take further steps to harden basic WinRM configurations, especially if the system will be remotely accessible over the Internet. Among some of these hardening options are:

- Configure `TrustedHosts` to include just IP addresses/hostnames that will be used for remote management
- Configure HTTPS for transport
- Join Windows systems to an Active Directory Domain Environment and Enforce Kerberos Authentication

 In most cases, one uses certificates or only specific authentication mechanisms to increase its security.
