[WinRM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal)Â Is an implementation of the WS-Management protocol. It can be used to manage the hardware and software functionalities of hosts. It is mainly used in IT administration but can also be used for host enumeration and as a scripting engine.

The Windows Remote Management (`WinRM`) is a simple Windows integrated remote management protocol based on the command line. WinRM uses the Simple Object Access Protocol (`SOAP`) to establish connections to remote hosts and their applications. Therefore, WinRM must be explicitly enabled and configured starting with Windows 10.

IT admins should take further steps to harden basic WinRM configurations, especially if the system will be remotely accessible over the Internet. Among some of these hardening options are:

- Configure TrustedHosts to include just IP addresses/hostnames that will be used for remote management
- Configure HTTPS for transport
- Join Windows systems to an Active Directory Domain Environment and Enforce Kerberos Authentication
