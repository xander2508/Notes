`Simple Network Management Protocol`Â ([SNMP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1157)) was created to monitor network devices. In addition, this protocol can also be used to handle configuration tasks and change settings remotely.

SNMP-enabled hardware includes routers, switches, servers, IoT devices, and many other devices that can also be queried and controlled using this standard protocol. Thus, it is a protocol for monitoring and managing network devices. In addition, configuration tasks can be handled, and settings can be made remotely using this standard.

## Guide

1. Walk SNMP to return useful information: [[SnmpWalk]]
2. Brute force community strings: [[Onesixtyone]]
3. Once the community strings are known: [[braa]]
