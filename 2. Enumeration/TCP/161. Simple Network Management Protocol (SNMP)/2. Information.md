The current version is `SNMPv3`, which increases the security of SNMP in particular, but also the complexity of using this protocol.

In addition to the pure exchange of information, SNMP also transmits control commands using agents over UDP port `161`. The client can set specific values in the device and change options and settings with these commands. While in classical communication, it is always the client who actively requests information from the server, SNMP also enables the use of so-called `traps` over UDP port `162`. These are data packets sent from the SNMP server to the client without being explicitly requested. If a device is configured accordingly, an SNMP trap is sent to the client once a specific event occurs on the server-side.

For the SNMP client and server to exchange the respective values, the available SNMP objects must have unique addresses known on both sides. This addressing mechanism is an absolute prerequisite for successfully transmitting data and network monitoring using SNMP.

#### MIB

To ensure that SNMP access works across manufacturers and with different client-server combinations, the `Management Information Base` (`MIB`) was created. MIB is an independent format for storing device information. A MIB is a text file in which all queryable SNMP objects of a device are listed in a standardized tree hierarchy. It contains at least one `Object Identifier` (`OID`), which, in addition to the necessary unique address and a name, also provides information about the type, access rights, and a description of the respective object. MIB files are written in the `Abstract Syntax Notation One` (`ASN.1`) based ASCII text format. The MIBs do not contain data, but they explain where to find which information and what it looks like, which returns values for the specific OID, or which data type is used.

#### OID

An OID represents a node in a hierarchical namespace. A sequence of numbers uniquely identifies each node, allowing the node's position in the tree to be determined. The longer the chain, the more specific the information. Many nodes in the OID tree contain nothing except references to those below them. The OIDs consist of integers and are usually concatenated by dot notation. We can look up many MIBs for the associated OIDs in the [Object Identifier Registry](https://www.alvestrand.no/objectid/).
