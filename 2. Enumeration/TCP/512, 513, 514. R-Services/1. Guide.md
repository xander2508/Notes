R-Services are a suite of services hosted to enable remote access or issue commands between Unix hosts over TCP/IP.

Initially developed by the Computer Systems Research Group (`CSRG`) at the University of California, Berkeley, `r-services` were the de facto standard for remote access between Unix operating systems until they were replaced by the Secure Shell (`SSH`) protocols and commands due to inherent security flaws built into them. Much like `telnet`, r-services transmit information from client to server(and vice versa.) over the network in an unencrypted format, making it possible for attackers to intercept network traffic (passwords, login information, etc.) by performing man-in-the-middle (`MITM`) attacks.

`R-services` span across the ports `512`, `513`, and `514` and are only accessible through a suite of programs known as `r-commands`. They are most commonly used by commercial operating systems such as Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX.

The [R-commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_r-commands) suite consists of the following programs:

- rcp (`remote copy`)
- rexec (`remote execution`)
- rlogin (`remote login`)
- rsh (`remote shell`)
- rstat
- ruptime
- rwho (`remote who`)

The table below will provide a quick overview of the most frequently abused commands, including the service daemon they interact with, over what port and transport method to which they can be accessed, and a brief description of each.

|**Command**|**Service Daemon**|**Port**|**Transport Protocol**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`rcp`|`rshd`|514|TCP|Copy a file or directory bidirectionally from the local system to the remote system (or vice versa) or from one remote system to another. It works like the `cp` command on Linux but provides `no warning to the user for overwriting existing files on a system`.|
|`rsh`|`rshd`|514|TCP|Opens a shell on a remote machine without a login procedure. Relies upon the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files for validation.|
|`rexec`|`rexecd`|512|TCP|Enables a user to run shell commands on a remote machine. Requires authentication through the use of a `username` and `password` through an unencrypted network socket. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files.|
|`rlogin`|`rlogind`|513|TCP|Enables a user to log in to a remote host over the network. It works similarly to `telnet` but can only connect to Unix-like hosts. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files.|
