The [Remote Procedure Call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/) (`RPC`) is a concept and, therefore, also a central tool to realize operational and work-sharing structures in networks and client-server architectures. 

RPC provides an application developer a generic way to execute a procedure (a.k.a. a function) in a local or remote process without having to understand the network protocols used to support the communication.

The communication process via RPC includes passing parameters and the return of a function value.

Apart from enumeration, we can use RPC to make changes to the system, such as:

- Change a user's password.
- Create a new domain user.
- Create a new shared folder.
