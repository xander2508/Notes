Samba implements the `Common Internet File System` (`CIFS`) network protocol. [CIFS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-cifs/934c2faa-54af-4526-ac74-6a24d126724e) is a "dialect" of SMB. In other words, CIFS is a very specific implementation of the SMB protocol, which in turn was created by Microsoft. This allows Samba to communicate with newer Windows systems. Therefore, it usually is referred to as `SMB / CIFS`. However, CIFS is the extension of the SMB protocol. So when we pass SMB commands over Samba to an older NetBIOS service, it usually connects to the Samba server over TCP ports `137`, `138`, `139`, but CIFS uses TCP port `445` only.

With version 3, the Samba server gained the ability to be a full member of an Active Directory domain. With version 4, Samba even provides an Active Directory domain controller. It contains several so-called daemons for this purpose - which are Unix background programs. The SMB server daemon (`smbd`) belonging to Samba provides the first two functionalities, while the [[2. Enumeration/UDP/137. Netbios/1. Guide|NetBios]] message block daemon (`nmbd`) implements the last two functionalities. The SMB service controls these two background programs.


#### Default Configuration

[Samba Configuration](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smb.conf.5.html)

```shell-session
[global]
   workgroup = DEV.INFREIGHT.HTB
   server string = DEVSMB
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
   max log size = 1000
   logging = file
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d

   server role = standalone server
   obey pam restrictions = yes
   unix password sync = yes

   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .

   pam password change = yes
   map to guest = bad user
   usershare allow guests = yes

[printers]
   comment = All Printers
   browseable = no
   path = /var/spool/samba
   printable = yes
   guest ok = no
   read only = yes
   create mask = 0700

[print$]
   comment = Printer Drivers
   path = /var/lib/samba/printers
   browseable = yes
   read only = yes
   guest ok = no
```

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`[sharename]`|The name of the network share.|
|`workgroup = WORKGROUP/DOMAIN`|Workgroup that will appear when clients query.|
|`path = /path/here/`|The directory to which user is to be given access.|
|`server string = STRING`|The string that will show up when a connection is initiated.|
|`unix password sync = yes`|Synchronize the UNIX password with the SMB password?|
|`usershare allow guests = yes`|Allow non-authenticated users to access defined share?|
|`map to guest = bad user`|What to do when a user login request doesn't match a valid UNIX user?|
|`browseable = yes`|Should this share be shown in the list of available shares?|
|`guest ok = yes`|Allow connecting to the service without using a password?|
|`read only = yes`|Allow users to read files only?|
|`create mask = 0700`|What permissions need to be set for newly created files?|
