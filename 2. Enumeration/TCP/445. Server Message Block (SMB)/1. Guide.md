[SMB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-smb2/4287490c-602c-41c0-a23e-140a1f137832) provides Windows hosts with the capability to share resources, files, and a standard way of authenticating between hosts to determine if access to resources is allowed. For other distros, [[Samba]] is the open-source option.

 [SMB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-smb/f210069c-7086-4dc2-885e-861d837df688) first became available to a broader public, for example, as part of the OS/2 network operating system LAN Manager and LAN Server. Since then, the main application area of the protocol has been the Windows operating system series in particular, whose network services support SMB in a downward-compatible manner - which means that devices with newer editions can easily communicate with devices that have an older Microsoft operating system installed. With the free software project Samba, there is also a solution that enables the use of SMB in Linux and Unix distributions and thus cross-platform communication via SMB.
 
 An SMB server can provide arbitrary parts of its local file system as shares. Therefore the hierarchy visible to a client is partially independent of the structure on the server. Access rights are defined by `Access Control Lists` (`ACL`). They can be controlled in a fine-grained manner based on attributes such as `execute`, `read`, and `full access` for individual users or user groups. The ACLs are defined based on the shares and therefore do not correspond to the rights assigned locally on the server.

In a network, each host participates in the same `workgroup`. A workgroup is a group name that identifies an arbitrary collection of computers and their resources on an SMB network. There can be multiple workgroups on the network at any given time. IBM developed an `application programming interface` (`API`) for networking computers called the `Network Basic Input/Output System` ([[2. Enumeration/UDP/137. Netbios/1. Guide|NetBios]]). 

## Guide

1. Getting access to the file system allows remote code execution, see [[Impacket]]
2. If you can get the victim to call back use [[1. Recon/Tooling/Responder|Responder]] to potentially capture creds
3. If you can get a user to click on a file, see [[Shell Command Files (SCF) File Attacks]]
4. **Active Directory Certificate Services** probably means a `/certsrv` on the [[2. Enumeration/TCP/80. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)/1. Guide|HTTP]] service
5. Brute forcing SMB is possible see [[Hydra#SMB]]

## Tooling 

1. [[1. Recon/Tooling/Responder|Responder]]
2. [[SMBMap]]
3. [[GPP-Decrypt]]
4. [[Secure copy protocol (SCP)]]
5. [[SMBClient]]
6. [[RpcClient]]
7. [[CrackMapExec]]
8. Heavy duty enumeration: [[enum4linux-ng]]
# Default Commands 

List shares

```
smbmap -H 10.10.10.10
```
or 
```
smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128
```

View share 

```
smbget -R -U "" smb://10.10.10.100/Replication
```

```
smbmap -u alex -p lol123\!mD -H 10.129.238.247 -r Users --depth 2
```

```shell-session
smbclient -U alex //10.129.14.128/notes
```

Mount shares 

```
sudo mount -t cifs  -o rw,guest,vers=3.0 //10.10.10.219/kanban/ /mnt/kanban
```

If this command is not working check the syntax. If the syntax is correct yet the command is still not working, `cifs-utils` may need to be installed. This can be done with the following command:

```shell-session
sudo apt-get install cifs-utils
```

To connect using a hash see [[SMBClient]]

#### Retrieve Service Information

The [[RpcClient]] offers us many different requests with which we can execute specific functions on the SMB server to get information.
