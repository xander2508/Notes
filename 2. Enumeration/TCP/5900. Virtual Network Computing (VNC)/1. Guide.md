`Virtual Network Computing` (`VNC`) is a remote desktop sharing system based on the RFB protocol that allows users to control a computer remotely. It allows a user to view and interact with a desktop environment remotely over a network connection. The user can control the remote computer as if sitting in front of it. This is also one of the most common protocols for remote graphical connections for Linux hosts.

VNC is generally considered to be secure. It uses encryption to ensure the data is safe while in transit and requires authentication before a user can gain access. Administrators make use of VNC to access computers that are not physically accessible. This could be used to troubleshoot and maintain servers, access applications on other computers, or provide remote access to workstations. VNC can also be used for screen sharing, allowing multiple users to collaborate on a project or troubleshoot a problem.

There are two different concepts for VNC servers. The usual server offers the actual screen of the host computer for user support. Because the keyboard and mouse remain usable at the remote computer, an arrangement is recommended. The second group of server programs allows user login to virtual sessions, similar to the terminal server concept.

Traditionally, the VNC server listens on TCP port 5900. So it offers its `display 0` there. Other displays can be offered via additional ports, mostly `590[x]`, where `x` is the display number. Adding multiple connections would be assigned to a higher TCP port like 5901, 5902, 5903, etc.

For these VNC connections, many different tools are used. Among them are for example:
