#### MSSQL Clients

[SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) (`SSMS`) comes as a feature that can be installed with the MSSQL install package or can be downloaded & installed separately. It is commonly installed on the server for initial configuration and long-term management of databases by admins. Keep in mind that since SSMS is a client-side application, it can be installed and used on any system an admin or developer is planning to manage the database from. It doesn't only exist on the server hosting the database. This means we could come across a vulnerable system with SSMS with saved credentials that allow us to connect to the database. The image below shows SSMS in action.

Many other clients can be used to access a database running on MSSQL. Including but not limited to:

#### MSSQL Databases


|Default System Database|Description|
|---|---|
|`master`|Tracks all system information for an SQL server instance|
|`model`|Template database that acts as a structure for every new database created. Any setting changed in the model database will be reflected in any new database created after changes to the model database|
|`msdb`|The SQL Server Agent uses this database to schedule jobs & alerts|
|`tempdb`|Stores temporary objects|
|`resource`|Read-only database containing system objects included with SQL server|

## Default Configuration

When an admin initially installs and configures MSSQL to be network accessible, the SQL service will likely run as `NT SERVICE\MSSQLSERVER`. Connecting from the client-side is possible through Windows Authentication, and by default, encryption is not enforced when attempting to connect.

Authentication being set to `Windows Authentication` means that the underlying Windows OS will process the login request and use either the local SAM database or the domain controller (hosting Active Directory) before allowing connectivity to the database management system. Using Active Directory can be ideal for auditing activity and controlling access in a Windows environment, but if an account is compromised, it could lead to privilege escalation and lateral movement across a Windows domain environment.

### Dangerous Settings

This is not an extensive list because there are countless ways MSSQL databases can be configured by admins based on the needs of their respective organizations. We may benefit from looking into the following:

- MSSQL clients not using encryption to connect to the MSSQL server
- The use of self-signed certificates when encryption is being used. It is possible to spoof self-signed [[CRT (Certificate Files)|certificate]]
- The use of [named pipes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/configuration-manager/named-pipes-properties?view=sql-server-ver15)
- Weak & default `sa` credentials. Admins may forget to disable this account

## Authentication Mechanisms

`MSSQL` supports two [authentication modes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/sql/authentication-sql-server), which means that users can be created in Windows or the SQL Server:

| **Authentication Type**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Windows authentication mode` | This is the default, often referred to as `integrated` security because the SQL Server security model is tightly integrated with Windows/Active Directory. Specific Windows user and group accounts are trusted to log in to SQL Server. Windows users who have already been authenticated do not have to present additional credentials. |
| `Mixed mode`                  | Mixed mode supports authentication by Windows/Active Directory accounts and SQL Server. Username and password pairs are maintained within SQL Server.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

`MySQL` also supports different [authentication methods](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/authentication-method.html), such as username and password, as well as Windows authentication (a plugin is required). In addition, administrators can [choose an authentication mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/choose-an-authentication-mode) for many reasons, including compatibility, security, usability, and more. However, depending on which method is implemented, misconfigurations can occur.
