[DNS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034)Â is a common naming standard used across the Internet and in most modern network types. DNS allows us to reference hosts by a unique name instead of their IP address. This is how we can reference a website by "www.google.com" instead of "8.8.8.8". Internally this is how we request resources and access from a network.

# Notes

* The DNS environment can be linked through proxies see [[2. Enumeration/TCP/3128. Squid Proxy/1. Guide|Squid Proxy]]
