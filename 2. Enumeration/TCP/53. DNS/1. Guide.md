[DNS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034) is a common naming standard used across the Internet and in most modern network types. DNS allows us to reference hosts by a unique name instead of their IP address. This is how we can reference a website by "www.google.com" instead of "8.8.8.8". Internally this is how we request resources and access from a network.

# Notes

* The DNS environment can be linked through proxies see [[2. Enumeration/TCP/3128. Squid Proxy/1. Guide|Squid Proxy]]
* DNS uses both TCP and UDP to communicate, beware of this when filtering traffic in [[1. Analysis Overview|Traffic Analysis]]

- **AAAA record** - The record that contains the IPv6 address for a domain (as opposed to A records, which list the IPv4 address). [Learn more about the AAAA record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-aaaa-record/)
- **CNAME record** - Forwards one domain or subdomain to another domain, does NOT provide an IP address. [Learn more about the CNAME record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-cname-record/)
- **MX record** - Directs mail to an email server. [Learn more about the MX record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-mx-record/)
- **TXT record** - Lets an admin store text notes in the record. These records are often used for email security. [Learn more about the TXT record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-txt-record/)
