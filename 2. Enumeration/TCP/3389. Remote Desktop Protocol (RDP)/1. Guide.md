This protocol allows display and control commands to be transmitted via the GUI encrypted over IP networks.


[RDP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/rds-plan-access-from-anywhere) is a Windows implementation of a network UI services protocol that provides users with a Graphical interface to access hosts over a network connection.
