RDP has handled [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) (`TLS/SSL`) since Windows Vista, which means that all data, and especially the login process, is protected in the network by its good encryption. However, many Windows systems do not insist on this but still accept inadequate encryption via [RDP Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rdpbcgr/8e8b2cca-c1fa-456c-8ecb-a82fc60b2322). Nevertheless, even with this, an attacker is still far from being locked out because the identity-providing certificates are merely self-signed by default. This means that the client cannot distinguish a genuine certificate from a forged one and generates a certificate warning for the user.

The `Remote Desktop` service is installed by default on Windows servers and does not require additional external applications. This service can be activated using the `Server Manager` and comes with the default setting to allow connections to the service only to hosts with [Network level authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Level_Authentication) (`NLA`).

## Enumeration

```shell-session
nmap -sV -sC 10.129.201.248 -p3389 --script rdp*
```

**BEWARE**, we can use `--packet-trace` to track the individual packages and inspect their contents manually. We can see that the `RDP cookies` (`mstshash=nmap`) used by Nmap to interact with the RDP server can be identified by `threat hunters` and various security services such as [Endpoint Detection and Response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endpoint_detection_and_response) (`EDR`), and can lock us out as penetration testers on hardened networks.
