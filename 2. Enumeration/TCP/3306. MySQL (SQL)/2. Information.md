#### MySQL Clients

The MySQL clients can retrieve and edit the data using structured queries to the database engine. Inserting, deleting, modifying, and retrieving data, is done using the SQL database language. Therefore, MySQL is suitable for managing many different databases to which clients can send multiple queries simultaneously. Depending on the use of the database, access is possible via an internal network or the public Internet.

#### MySQL Databases

MySQL is ideally suited for applications such as `dynamic websites`, where efficient syntax and high response speed are essential. It is often combined with a Linux OS, PHP, and an Apache web server and is also known in this combination as [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), or when using Nginx, as [LEMP](https://lemp.io/).

In a web hosting with MySQL database, this serves as a central instance in which content required by PHP scripts is stored. Among these are:

| Headers                 | Texts            | Meta tags         | Forms      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| Customers               | Usernames        | Administrators    | Moderators |
| Email addresses         | User information | Permissions       | Passwords  |
| External/Internal links | Links to Files   | Specific contents | Values     |

Sensitive data such as passwords can be stored in their plain-text form by MySQL; however, they are generally encrypted beforehand by the PHP scripts using secure methods such as [[4. Post-Exploitation/Cryptography/Hashes and Encryption/1. Guide|Hashing]]

#### MySQL Commands

A MySQL database translates the commands internally into executable code and performs the requested actions.
