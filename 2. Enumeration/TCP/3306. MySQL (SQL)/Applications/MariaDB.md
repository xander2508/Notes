`MariaDB`, which is often connected with MySQL, is a fork of the original MySQL code. This is because the chief developer of MySQL left the company `MySQL AB` after it was acquired by `Oracle` and developed another open-source SQL database management system based on the source code of MySQL and called it MariaDB.
