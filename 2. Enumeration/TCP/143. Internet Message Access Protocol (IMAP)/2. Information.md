## Default Configuration

Both IMAP and POP3 have a large number of configuration options.

In the documentation of Dovecot, we can find the individual [core settings](https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/core/) and [service configuration](https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/service_configuration/) options that can be utilized for our experiments. However, let us look at the list of commands and see how we can directly interact and communicate with [[2. Enumeration/TCP/143. Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)/1. Guide|IMAP]] and [[2. Enumeration/TCP/110. Post Office Protocol (POP3)/1. Guide|POP3]] using the command line.

### Dangerous Settings

 Many configuration mistakes can be made by administrators, which in the worst cases will allow us to read all the emails sent and received, which may even contain confidential or sensitive information. Some of these configuration options include:

| **Setting**               | **Description**                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auth_debug`              | Enables all authentication debug logging.                                                 |
| `auth_debug_passwords`    | This setting adjusts log verbosity, the submitted passwords, and the scheme gets logged.  |
| `auth_verbose`            | Logs unsuccessful authentication attempts and their reasons.                              |
| `auth_verbose_passwords`  | Passwords used for authentication are logged and can also be truncated.                   |
| `auth_anonymous_username` | This specifies the username to be used when logging in with the ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism. |
