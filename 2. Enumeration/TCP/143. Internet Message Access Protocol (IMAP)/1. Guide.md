`Internet Message Access Protocol` (`IMAP`) provides access to emails from a mail server.

Unlike the `Post Office Protocol` ([[2. Enumeration/TCP/110. Post Office Protocol (POP3)/1. Guide|POP3]]), IMAP allows online management of emails directly on the server and supports folder structures. Thus, it is a network protocol for the online management of emails on a remote server. The protocol is client-server-based and allows synchronization of a local email client with the mailbox on the server, providing a kind of network file system for emails, allowing problem-free synchronization across several independent clients.

Clients access these structures online and can create local copies. Even across several clients, this results in a uniform database. Emails remain on the server until they are deleted. IMAP is text-based and has extended functions, such as browsing emails directly on the server. It is also possible for several users to access the email server simultaneously. Without an active connection to the server, managing emails is impossible. However, some clients offer an offline mode with a local copy of the mailbox. The client synchronizes all offline local changes when a connection is re-established.

Access to the desired mailbox is only possible after successful authentication.

[[2. Enumeration/TCP/25. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)/1. Guide|SMTP]] is usually used to send emails. By copying sent emails into an IMAP folder, all clients have access to all sent mails, regardless of the computer from which they were sent. Another advantage of the Internet Message Access Protocol is creating personal folders and folder structures in the mailbox. This feature makes the mailbox clearer and easier to manage. However, the storage space requirement on the email server increases.

Many email servers require establishing an encrypted IMAP session to ensure greater security in email traffic and prevent unauthorized access to mailboxes. SSL/TLS is usually used for this purpose. Depending on the method and implementation used, the encrypted connection uses the standard port `143` or an alternative port such as `993`.

### Connect to IMAPs

```shell-session
curl -k 'imaps://10.129.14.128' --user user:p4ssw0rd
```
```shell-session
curl -k 'imaps://10.129.14.128' --user cry0l1t3:1234 -v
```

To interact with the IMAP or POP3 server over SSL, we can use `openssl`, as well as `ncat`. The commands for this would look like this:

```shell-session
openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.128:imaps
```
