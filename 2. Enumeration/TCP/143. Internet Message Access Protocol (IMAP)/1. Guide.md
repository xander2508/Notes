`Internet Message Access Protocol` (`IMAP`) provides access to emails from a mail server.

Unlike the `Post Office Protocol` ([[2. Enumeration/TCP/110. Post Office Protocol (POP)/1. Guide|POP3]]), IMAP allows online management of emails directly on the server and supports folder structures. Thus, it is a network protocol for the online management of emails on a remote server. The protocol is client-server-based and allows synchronization of a local email client with the mailbox on the server, providing a kind of network file system for emails, allowing problem-free synchronization across several independent clients.

Clients access these structures online and can create local copies. Even across several clients, this results in a uniform database. Emails remain on the server until they are deleted. IMAP is text-based and has extended functions, such as browsing emails directly on the server. It is also possible for several users to access the email server simultaneously. Without an active connection to the server, managing emails is impossible. However, some clients offer an offline mode with a local copy of the mailbox. The client synchronizes all offline local changes when a connection is re-established.
