[Rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) is a fast and efficient tool for locally and remotely copying files. It can be used to copy files locally on a given machine and to/from remote hosts. It is highly versatile and well-known for its delta-transfer algorithm. This algorithm reduces the amount of data transmitted over the network when a version of the file already exists on the destination host. It does this by sending only the differences between the source files and the older version of the files that reside on the destination server. It is often used for backups and mirroring. It finds files that need to be transferred by looking at files that have changed in size or the last modified time. By default, it uses port `873` and can be configured to use SSH for secure file transfers by piggybacking on top of an established SSH server connection.

## Enumeration

```shell-session
sudo nmap -sV -p 873 127.0.0.1
```

#### Probing for Accessible Shares

```shell-session
nc -nv 127.0.0.1 873

(UNKNOWN) [127.0.0.1] 873 (rsync) open
@RSYNCD: 31.0
@RSYNCD: 31.0
#list
dev            	Dev Tools
@RSYNCD: EXIT
```

#### Enumerating an Open Share

```shell-session
rsync -av --list-only rsync://127.0.0.1/dev
```
