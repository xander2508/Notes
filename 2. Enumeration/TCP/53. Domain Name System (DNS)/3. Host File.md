The `hosts` file is a simple text file used to map hostnames to IP addresses, providing a manual method of domain name resolution that bypasses the DNS process. While DNS automates the translation of domain names to IP addresses, the `hosts` file allows for direct, local overrides. This can be particularly useful for development, troubleshooting, or blocking websites.

The `hosts` file is located in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows and in `/etc/hosts` on Linux and MacOS. Each line in the file follows the format:

Code: txt

```txt
<IP Address>    <Hostname> [<Alias> ...]
```

For example:

Code: txt

```txt
127.0.0.1       localhost
192.168.1.10    devserver.local
```

To edit the `hosts` file, open it with a text editor using administrative/root privileges. Add new entries as needed, and then save the file. The changes take effect immediately without requiring a system restart.

Common uses include redirecting a domain to a local server for development:

Code: txt

```txt
127.0.0.1       myapp.local
```

testing connectivity by specifying an IP address:

Code: txt

```txt
192.168.1.20    testserver.local
```

or blocking unwanted websites by redirecting their domains to a non-existent IP address:

Code: txt

```txt
0.0.0.0       unwanted-site.com
```
