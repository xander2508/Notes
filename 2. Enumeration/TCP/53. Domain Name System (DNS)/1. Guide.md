[DNS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034) is a common naming standard used across the Internet and in most modern network types. DNS allows us to reference hosts by a unique name instead of their IP address. This is how we can reference a website by "www.google.com" instead of "8.8.8.8". Internally this is how we request resources and access from a network.

However, the DNS does not only link computer names and IP addresses. It also stores and outputs additional information about the services associated with a domain. A DNS query can therefore also be used, for example, to determine which computer serves as the e-mail server for the domain in question or what the domain's name servers are called.

1. See [[Validate DNS]]
2. The DNS environment can be linked through proxies see [[2. Enumeration/TCP/3128. Squid Proxy/1. Guide|Squid Proxy]]
3. DNS uses both TCP and UDP to communicate, beware of this when filtering traffic in [[1. Analysis Overview|Traffic Analysis]]

## Information 

| **Step**                                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `1. Query Initiation`                    | When the user wants to visit something like academy.hackthebox.com it initiates a DNS forward query.                                                                                             |
| `2. Local Cache Check`                   | The client then checks its local DNS cache to see if it has already resolved the domain name to an IP address. If not it continues with the following.                                           |
| `3. Recursive Query`                     | The client then sends its recursive query to its configured DNS server (local or remote).                                                                                                        |
| `4. Root Servers`                        | The DNS resolver, if necessary, starts by querying the root name servers to find the authoritative name servers for the top-level domain (TLD). There are 13 root servers distributed worldwide. |
| `5. TLD Servers`                         | The root server then responds with the authoritative name servers for the TLD (aka .com or .org)                                                                                                 |
| `6. Authoritative Servers`               | The DNS resolver then queries the TLD's authoritative name servers for the second-level domain (aka hackthebox.com).                                                                             |
| `7. Domain Name's Authoritative Servers` | Finally, the DNS resolver queries the domains authoritative name servers to obtain the IP address associated with the requested domain name (aka academy.hackthebox.com).                        |
| `8. Response`                            | The DNS resolver then receives the IP address (A or AAAA record) and sends it back to the client that initiated the query.                                                                       |

## Record Types 

- **A record** - The record that holds the IP address of a domain. [Learn more about the A record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-a-record/)
- **AAAA record** - The record that contains the IPv6 address for a domain (as opposed to A records, which list the IPv4 address). [Learn more about the AAAA record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-aaaa-record/)
- **CNAME record** - Forwards one domain or subdomain to another domain, does NOT provide an IP address. [Learn more about the CNAME record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-cname-record/)
- **MX record** - Directs mail to an email server. [Learn more about the MX record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-mx-record/)

- **NS record** - Stores the name server for a DNS entry. [Learn more about the NS record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ns-record/)
- **SOA record** - Stores admin information about a domain. [Learn more about the SOA record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-soa-record/)
- **SRV record** - Specifies a port for specific services. [Learn more about the SRV record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-srv-record/) Contains DNS zone information and contact information for the administrator.
* **PTR record** - Provides a domain name in reverse-lookups. [Learn more about the PTR record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ptr-record/)

## DNS Reverse Lookups/Queries

[Domain DNS Record and WHOIS Information](https://domain.glass/)

On the opposite side, we have Reverse Lookups. These occur when a client already knows the IP address and wants to find the corresponding FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).

| **Step**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1. Query Initiation`     | The client sends a DNS reverse query to its configured DNS resolver (server) with the IP address it wants to find the domain name.                                                                                    |
| `2. Reverse Lookup Zones` | The DNS resolver checks if it is authoritative for the reverse lookup zone that corresponds to the IP range as determined by the received IP address. Aka 192.0.2.1, the reverse zone would be 1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa |
| `3. PTR Record Query`     | The DNS resolver then looks for a PTR record on the reverse lookup zone that corresponds to the provided IP address.                                                                                                  |
| `4. Response`             | If a matching PTR is found, the DNS server (resolver) then returns the FQDN of the IP for the client.                                                                                                                 |

## Servers 

There are several types of DNS servers that are used worldwide:

- DNS root server
- Authoritative name server
- Non-authoritative name server
- Caching server
- Forwarding server
- Resolver

| **Server Type**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DNS Root Server`              | The root servers of the DNS are responsible for the top-level domains (`TLD`). As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org/) (`ICANN`) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are `13` such root servers around the globe. |
| `Authoritative Nameserver`     | Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Non-authoritative Nameserver` | Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Caching DNS Server`           | Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Forwarding Server`            | Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Resolver`                     | Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

DNS is mainly unencrypted. Since this poses a privacy risk, there are now some solutions for DNS encryption. By default, IT security professionals apply `DNS over TLS` (`DoT`) or `DNS over HTTPS` (`DoH`) here. In addition, the network protocol `DNSCrypt` also encrypts the traffic between the computer and the name server.

## Default Configuration

There are many different configuration types for DNS. Therefore, we will only discuss the most important ones to illustrate better the functional principle from an administrative point of view. All DNS servers work with three different types of configuration files:

1. local DNS configuration files
2. zone files
3. reverse name resolution files
 
The DNS server [[Bind9]]] is very often used on Linux-based distributions. Its local configuration file (`named.conf`) is roughly divided into two sections, firstly the options section for general settings and secondly the zone entries for the individual domains. The local configuration files are usually:

- `named.conf.local`
- `named.conf.options`
- `named.conf.log`

It contains the associated RFC where we can customize the server to our needs and our domain structure with the individual zones for different domains. The configuration file `named.conf` is divided into several options that control the behaviour of the name server. A distinction is made between `global options` and `zone options`.

Global options are general and affect all zones. A zone option only affects the zone to which it is assigned. Options not listed in `named.conf` have default values. If an option is both global and zone-specific, then the zone option takes precedence.

#### Local DNS Configuration

```shell-session
root@bind9:~# cat /etc/bind/named.conf.local

//
// Do any local configuration here
//

// Consider adding the 1918 zones here, if they are not used in your
// organization
//include "/etc/bind/zones.rfc1918";
zone "domain.com" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/db.domain.com";
    allow-update { key rndc-key; };
};
```
