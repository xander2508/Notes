[DNS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034) is a common naming standard used across the Internet and in most modern network types. DNS allows us to reference hosts by a unique name instead of their IP address. This is how we can reference a website by "www.google.com" instead of "8.8.8.8". Internally this is how we request resources and access from a network.

However, the DNS does not only link computer names and IP addresses. It also stores and outputs additional information about the services associated with a domain. A DNS query can therefore also be used, for example, to determine which computer serves as the e-mail server for the domain in question or what the domain's name servers are called.
# Guide 

1. See [[Validate DNS]]
2. The DNS environment can be linked through proxies see [[2. Enumeration/TCP/3128. Squid Proxy/1. Guide|Squid Proxy]]
3. DNS uses both TCP and UDP to communicate, beware of this when filtering traffic in [[1. Analysis Overview|Traffic Analysis]]

## Enumeration

1. Query the found DNS server for other known Name Servers (NS):

We do this using the NS record and the specification of the DNS server we want to query using the `@` character:
```shell-session
dig ns inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128
```

2. Version query

```shell-session
dig CH TXT version.bind 10.129.120.85
```

3. Get all entries it is willing to show

```shell-session
dig any inlanefreight.htb @10.129.14.128
```
