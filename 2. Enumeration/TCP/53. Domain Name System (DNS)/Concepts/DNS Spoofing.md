DNS spoofing is also referred to as DNS Cache Poisoning. This attack involves altering legitimate DNS records with false information so that they can be used to redirect online traffic to a fraudulent website. Example attack paths for the DNS Cache Poisoning are as follows:

- An attacker could intercept the communication between a user and a DNS server to route the user to a fraudulent destination instead of a legitimate one by performing a Man-in-the-Middle (`MITM`) attack.
    
- Exploiting a vulnerability found in a DNS server could yield control over the server by an attacker to modify the DNS records.
