How DNS functions:

| **Step**                                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `1. Query Initiation`                    | When the user wants to visit something like academy.hackthebox.com it initiates a DNS forward query.                                                                                             |
| `2. Local Cache Check`                   | The client then checks its local DNS cache to see if it has already resolved the domain name to an IP address. If not it continues with the following.                                           |
| `3. Recursive Query`                     | The client then sends its recursive query to its configured DNS server (local or remote).                                                                                                        |
| `4. Root Servers`                        | The DNS resolver, if necessary, starts by querying the root name servers to find the authoritative name servers for the top-level domain (TLD). There are 13 root servers distributed worldwide. |
| `5. TLD Servers`                         | The root server then responds with the authoritative name servers for the TLD (aka .com or .org)                                                                                                 |
| `6. Authoritative Servers`               | The DNS resolver then queries the TLD's authoritative name servers for the second-level domain (aka hackthebox.com).                                                                             |
| `7. Domain Name's Authoritative Servers` | Finally, the DNS resolver queries the domains authoritative name servers to obtain the IP address associated with the requested domain name (aka academy.hackthebox.com).                        |
| `8. Response`                            | The DNS resolver then receives the IP address (A or AAAA record) and sends it back to the client that initiated the query.                                                                       |

## DNS Reverse Lookups/Queries

[[Domain Glass (WHOIS)|WHOIS]]

On the opposite side, we have Reverse Lookups. These occur when a client already knows the IP address and wants to find the corresponding FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).

| **Step**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1. Query Initiation`     | The client sends a DNS reverse query to its configured DNS resolver (server) with the IP address it wants to find the domain name.                                                                                    |
| `2. Reverse Lookup Zones` | The DNS resolver checks if it is authoritative for the reverse lookup zone that corresponds to the IP range as determined by the received IP address. Aka 192.0.2.1, the reverse zone would be 1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa |
| `3. PTR Record Query`     | The DNS resolver then looks for a PTR record on the reverse lookup zone that corresponds to the provided IP address.                                                                                                  |
| `4. Response`             | If a matching PTR is found, the DNS server (resolver) then returns the FQDN of the IP for the client.                                                                                                                 |

## Servers 

There are several types of DNS servers that are used worldwide:

- DNS root server
- Authoritative name server
- Non-authoritative name server
- Caching server
- Forwarding server
- Resolver

| **Server Type**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DNS Root Server`              | The root servers of the DNS are responsible for the top-level domains (`TLD`). As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org/) (`ICANN`) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are `13` such root servers around the globe. |
| `Authoritative Nameserver`     | Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Non-authoritative Nameserver` | Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Caching DNS Server`           | Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Forwarding Server`            | Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Resolver`                     | Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

DNS is mainly unencrypted. Since this poses a privacy risk, there are now some solutions for DNS encryption. By default, IT security professionals apply `DNS over TLS` (`DoT`) or `DNS over HTTPS` (`DoH`) here. In addition, the network protocol `DNSCrypt` also encrypts the traffic between the computer and the name server.

## Default Configuration

There are many different configuration types for DNS. Therefore, we will only discuss the most important ones to illustrate better the functional principle from an administrative point of view. All DNS servers work with three different types of configuration files:

1. local DNS configuration files
2. zone files
3. reverse name resolution files
 
The DNS server [[Bind9]]] is very often used on Linux-based distributions. Its local configuration file (`named.conf`) is roughly divided into two sections, firstly the options section for general settings and secondly the zone entries for the individual domains. The local configuration files are usually:

- `named.conf.local`
- `named.conf.options`
- `named.conf.log`

It contains the associated RFC where we can customize the server to our needs and our domain structure with the individual zones for different domains. The configuration file `named.conf` is divided into several options that control the behaviour of the name server. A distinction is made between `global options` and `zone options`.

Global options are general and affect all zones. A zone option only affects the zone to which it is assigned. Options not listed in `named.conf` have default values. If an option is both global and zone-specific, then the zone option takes precedence.

#### Local DNS Configuration

```shell-session
root@bind9:~# cat /etc/bind/named.conf.local

//
// Do any local configuration here
//

// Consider adding the 1918 zones here, if they are not used in your
// organization
//include "/etc/bind/zones.rfc1918";
zone "domain.com" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/db.domain.com";
    allow-update { key rndc-key; };
};
```

A `zone file` is a text file that describes a DNS zone with the BIND file format. In other words it is a point of delegation in the DNS tree. The BIND file format is the industry-preferred zone file format and is now well established in DNS server software. A zone file describes a zone completely. There must be precisely one `SOA` record and at least one `NS` record. The SOA resource record is usually located at the beginning of a zone file. The main goal of these global rules is to improve the readability of zone files. A syntax error usually results in the entire zone file being considered unusable. The name server behaves similarly as if this zone did not exist. It responds to DNS queries with a `SERVFAIL` error message.

In short, here, all `forward records` are entered according to the BIND format. This allows the DNS server to identify which domain, hostname, and role the IP addresses belong to. In simple terms, this is the phone book where the DNS server looks up the addresses for the domains it is searching for.

```shell-session
root@bind9:~# cat /etc/bind/db.domain.com

;
; BIND reverse data file for local loopback interface
;
$ORIGIN domain.com
$TTL 86400
@     IN     SOA    dns1.domain.com.     hostmaster.domain.com. (
                    2001062501 ; serial
                    21600      ; refresh after 6 hours
                    3600       ; retry after 1 hour
                    604800     ; expire after 1 week
                    86400 )    ; minimum TTL of 1 day

      IN     NS     ns1.domain.com.
      IN     NS     ns2.domain.com.

      IN     MX     10     mx.domain.com.
      IN     MX     20     mx2.domain.com.

             IN     A       10.129.14.5

server1      IN     A       10.129.14.5
server2      IN     A       10.129.14.7
ns1          IN     A       10.129.14.2
ns2          IN     A       10.129.14.3

ftp          IN     CNAME   server1
mx           IN     CNAME   server1
mx2          IN     CNAME   server2
www          IN     CNAME   server2
```

For the IP address to be resolved from the `Fully Qualified Domain Name` (`FQDN`), the DNS server must have a reverse lookup file. In this file, the computer name (FQDN) is assigned to the last octet of an IP address, which corresponds to the respective host, using a `PTR` record. The PTR records are responsible for the reverse translation of IP addresses into names, as we have already seen in the above table.

#### Reverse Name Resolution Zone Files

```shell-session
root@bind9:~# cat /etc/bind/db.10.129.14

;
; BIND reverse data file for local loopback interface
;
$ORIGIN 14.129.10.in-addr.arpa
$TTL 86400
@     IN     SOA    dns1.domain.com.     hostmaster.domain.com. (
                    2001062501 ; serial
                    21600      ; refresh after 6 hours
                    3600       ; retry after 1 hour
                    604800     ; expire after 1 week
                    86400 )    ; minimum TTL of 1 day

      IN     NS     ns1.domain.com.
      IN     NS     ns2.domain.com.

5    IN     PTR    server1.domain.com.
7    IN     MX     mx.domain.com.
...SNIP...
```

## Dangerous Settings

DNS can get very complicated and it is very easy for errors to creep into this service, forcing an administrator to work around the problem until they find an exact solution. This often leads to elements being released so that parts of the infrastructure function as planned and desired. In such cases, functionality has a higher priority than security, which leads to misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `allow-query`     | Defines which hosts are allowed to send requests to the DNS server.            |
| `allow-recursion` | Defines which hosts are allowed to send recursive requests to the DNS server.  |
| `allow-transfer`  | Defines which hosts are allowed to receive zone transfers from the DNS server. |
| `zone-statistics` | Collects statistical data of zones.                                            |


## Zone Transfers 

`Zone transfer` refers to the transfer of zones to another server in DNS, which generally happens over TCP port 53. This procedure is abbreviated `Asynchronous Full Transfer Zone` (`AXFR`). Since a DNS failure usually has severe consequences for a company, the zone file is almost invariably kept identical on several name servers. When changes are made, it must be ensured that all servers have the same data. Synchronization between the servers involved is realized by zone transfer. Using a secret key `rndc-key`, which we have seen initially in the default configuration, the servers make sure that they communicate with their own master or slave. Zone transfer involves the mere transfer of files or records and the detection of discrepancies in the data sets of the servers involved.

The original data of a zone is located on a DNS server, which is called the `primary` name server for this zone. However, to increase the reliability, realize a simple load distribution, or protect the primary from attacks, one or more additional servers are installed in practice in almost all cases, which are called `secondary` name servers for this zone. For some `Top-Level Domains` (`TLDs`), making zone files for the `Second Level Domains` accessible on at least two servers is mandatory.

DNS entries are generally only created, modified, or deleted on the primary. This can be done by manually editing the relevant zone file or automatically by a dynamic update from a database. A DNS server that serves as a direct source for synchronizing a zone file is called a master. A DNS server that obtains zone data from a master is called a slave. A primary is always a master, while a secondary can be both a slave and a master.

The slave fetches the `SOA` record of the relevant zone from the master at certain intervals, the so-called refresh time, usually one hour, and compares the serial numbers. If the serial number of the SOA record of the master is greater than that of the slave, the data sets no longer match.
