[GitHub - projectdiscovery/subfinder: Fast passive subdomain enumeration tool.](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder)

`subfinder` is a subdomain discovery tool that returns valid subdomains for websites, using passive online sources. It has a simple, modular architecture and is optimized for speed. `subfinder` is built for doing one thing only - passive subdomain enumeration, and it does that very well.
