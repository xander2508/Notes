**host** is a simple utility for performing DNS lookups. It is normally used to convert names to IP addresses and vice versa. When no arguments or options are given, **host** prints a short summary of its command line arguments and options.

_name_ is the domain name that is to be looked up. It can also be a dotted-decimal IPv4 address or a colon-delimited IPv6 address, in which case **host** will by default perform a reverse lookup for that address. _server_ is an optional argument which is either the name or IP address of the name server that **host** should query instead of the server or servers listed in `/etc/resolv.conf`.
