[GitHub - TheRook/subbrute: A DNS meta-query spider that enumerates DNS records, and subdomains.](https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute)

SubBrute is a community driven project with the goal of creating the fastest, and most accurate subdomain enumeration tool.

This tool allows us to use self-defined resolvers and perform pure DNS brute-forcing attacks during internal penetration tests on hosts that do not have Internet access.
