[LDAP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4511) is an `open-source` cross-platform protocol used for `authentication` and `authorization` with various directory services. This is how many different devices in modern networks can communicate with large directory structure services such as [[What is Active Directory|Active Directory]]

The latest LDAP specification is [Version 3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511), published as RFC 4511
[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol)

While uncommon, you may come across organization while performing an assessment that do not have AD but are using LDAP, meaning that they most likely use another type of LDAP server such as [OpenLDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenLDAP).
## Active Directory Usage

AD stores user account information and security information such as passwords and facilitates sharing this information with other devices on the network. LDAP is the language that applications use to communicate with other servers that provide directory services. In other words, LDAP is how systems in the network environment can "speak" to AD.
