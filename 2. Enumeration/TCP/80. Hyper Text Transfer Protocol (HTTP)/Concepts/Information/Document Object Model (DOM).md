[Document Object Model - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.

The `<head>` element usually contains elements that are not directly printed on the page, like the page title, while all main page elements are located under `<body>`. Other important elements include the `<style>`, which holds the page's CSS code, and the `<script>`, which holds the JS code of the page, as we will see in the next section. Each of these elements is called a [DOM (Document Object Model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model). 

The DOM standard is separated into 3 parts:

- `Core DOM` - the standard model for all document types
- `XML DOM` - the standard model for XML documents
- `HTML DOM` - the standard model for HTML documents
