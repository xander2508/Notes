[Voice over Internet Protocol](https://www.fcc.gov/general/voice-over-internet-protocol-voip) (`VoIP`) is a method of transmitting voice and multimedia communications. For example, it allows us to make phone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a traditional phone line, like Skype, Whatsapp, Google Hangouts, Slack, Zoom, and others.

|**Method**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`INVITE`|Initiates a session or invites another endpoint to participate.|
|`ACK`|Confirms the receipt of an INVITE request.|
|`BYE`|Terminate a session.|
|`CANCEL`|Cancels a pending INVITE request.|
|`REGISTER`|Registers a SIP user agent (UA) with a SIP server.|
|`OPTIONS`|Requests information about the capabilities of a SIP server or user agent, such as the types of media it supports.|
One of the possible ways to enumerate users is the SIP `OPTIONS` request. It is a method used to request information about the capabilities of a SIP server or user agents, such as the types of media it supports, the codecs it can decode, and other details. The `OPTIONS` request can probe a SIP server or user agent for information or test its connectivity and availability.
