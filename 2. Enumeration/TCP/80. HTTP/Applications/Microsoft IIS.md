[IIS (Internet Information Services)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services) is the third most common web server on the internet, hosting around `15%` of all internet web sites. `IIS` is developed and maintained by Microsoft and mainly runs on Microsoft Windows Servers. `IIS` is usually used to host web applications developed for the Microsoft .NET framework, but can also be used to host web applications developed in other languages like `PHP`, or host other types of services like `FTP`. Furthermore, `IIS` is very well optimized for Active Directory integration and includes features like `Windows Auth` for authenticating users using Active Directory, allowing them to automatically sign in to web applications.

Though not the most popular web server, many big organizations use `IIS` as their web server. Many of them use Windows Server on their back end or rely heavily on Active Directory within their organization. Some popular websites that utilize IIS include:

| `Microsoft` | `Office365` | `Skype` | `Stack Overflow` | `Dell` |
