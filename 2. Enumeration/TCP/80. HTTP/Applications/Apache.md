[Apache](https://www.apache.org/) 'or `httpd`' is the most common web server on the internet, hosting more than `40%` of all internet websites. `Apache` usually comes pre-installed in most `Linux` distributions and can also be installed on Windows and macOS servers.

`Apache` is usually used with `PHP` for web application development, but it also supports other languages like `.Net`, `Python`, `Perl`, and even OS languages like `Bash` through `CGI`. Users can install a wide variety of `Apache` modules to extend its functionality and support more languages. For example, to support serving `PHP` files, users must install `PHP` on the back end server, in addition to installing the `mod_php` module for `Apache`.

`Apache` is an open-source project, and community users can access its source code to fix issues and look for vulnerabilities. It is well-maintained and regularly patched against vulnerabilities to keep it safe against exploitation. Furthermore, it is very well documented, making using and configuring different parts of the webserver relatively easy. `Apache` is commonly used by startups and smaller companies, as it is straightforward to develop for. Still, some big companies utilize Apache, including:
