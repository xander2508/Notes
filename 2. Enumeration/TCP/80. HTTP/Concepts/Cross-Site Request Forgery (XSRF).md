A Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) is also known as “one-click attack” and “session riding”. The idea is that an attacker can craft a url such that when a target visits it, some actions or commands are taken that the user may not have wanted to take. For a site that’s vulnerable to XSRF, this can be a nasty attack, since the attacker can control the text of the link they send the target, making it not too hard to trick people into clicking on links.
