[CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) is the stylesheet language used alongside HTML to format and set the style of HTML elements. Like HTML, there are several versions of CSS, and each subsequent version introduces a new set of capabilities that can be used for formatting HTML elements. Browsers are updated alongside it to support these new features.

CSS defines the style of each HTML element or class between curly brackets `{}`, within which the properties are defined with their values (i.e. `element { property : value; }`).

```css
body {
  background-color: black;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: helvetica;
  font-size: 10px;
}
```

Each HTML element has many properties that can be set through CSS, such as `height`, `position`, `border`, `margin`, `padding`, `color`, `text-align`, `font-size`, and hundreds of other properties. All of these can be combined and used to design visually appealing web pages.

CSS can be used for advanced animations for a wide variety of uses, from moving items all the way to advanced 3D animations. Many CSS properties are available for animations, like `@keyframes`, `animation`, `animation-duration`, `animation-direction`, and many others. You can read about and try out many of these animation properties [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp).

CSS is often used alongside JavaScript to make quick calculations, dynamically adjust the style properties of certain HTML elements, or achieve advanced animations based on keystrokes or the mouse cursor location.
