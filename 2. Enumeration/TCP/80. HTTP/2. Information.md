![[Pasted image 20240513193124.png]]If we type `http://` instead of `https://` to visit a website that enforces HTTPS, the browser attempts to resolve the domain and redirects the user to the webserver hosting the target website. A request is sent to port `80` first, which is the unencrypted HTTP protocol. The server detects this and redirects the client to secure HTTPS port `443` instead. This is done via the `301 Moved Permanently` response code, which we will discuss in an upcoming section.

Next, the client (web browser) sends a "client hello" packet, giving information about itself. After this, the server replies with "server hello", followed by a [key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_exchange) to exchange SSL certificates. The client verifies the key/certificate and sends one of its own. After this, an encrypted [handshake](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake) is initiated to confirm whether the encryption and transfer are working correctly.

Once the handshake completes successfully, normal HTTP communication is continued, which is encrypted after that.

## HTTP Request

Let's start by examining the following example HTTP request:

![raw_request](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/35/raw_request.png)

The image above shows an HTTP GET request to the URL:

- `http://inlanefreight.com/users/login.html`

The first line of any HTTP request contains three main fields 'separated by spaces':

|**Field**|**Example**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`Method`|`GET`|The HTTP method or verb, which specifies the type of action to perform.|
|`Path`|`/users/login.html`|The path to the resource being accessed. This field can also be suffixed with a query string (e.g. `?username=user`).|
|`Version`|`HTTP/1.1`|The third and final field is used to denote the HTTP version.|

The next set of lines contain HTTP header value pairs, like `Host`, `User-Agent`, `Cookie`, and many other possible headers. These headers are used to specify various attributes of a request. The headers are terminated with a new line, which is necessary for the server to validate the request. Finally, a request may end with the request body and data.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** HTTP version 1.X sends requests as clear-text, and uses a new-line character to separate different fields and different requests. HTTP version 2.X, on the other hand, sends requests as binary data in a dictionary form.

## HTTP Response

Once the server processes our request, it sends its response. The following is an example HTTP response:

![raw_response](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/35/raw_response.png)

The first line of an HTTP response contains two fields separated by spaces. The first being the `HTTP version` (e.g. `HTTP/1.1`), and the second denotes the `HTTP response code` (e.g. `200 OK`).

# HTTP Headers

Headers can have one or multiple values, appended after the header name and separated by a colon. We can divide headers into the following categories:

1. `General Headers`
2. `Entity Headers`
3. `Request Headers`
4. `Response Headers`
5. `Security Headers`

## General Headers

[General headers](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html) are used in both HTTP requests and responses. They are contextual and are used to `describe the message rather than its contents`.

|**Header**|**Example**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`Date`|`Date: Wed, 16 Feb 2022 10:38:44 GMT`|Holds the date and time at which the message originated. It's preferred to convert the time to the standard [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) time zone.|
|`Connection`|`Connection: close`|Dictates if the current network connection should stay alive after the request finishes. Two commonly used values for this header are `close` and `keep-alive`. The `close` value from either the client or server means that they would like to terminate the connection, while the `keep-alive` header indicates that the connection should remain open to receive more data and input.|

---

## Entity Headers

Similar to general headers, [Entity Headers](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec7.html) can be `common to both the request and response`. These headers are used to `describe the content` (entity) transferred by a message. They are usually found in responses and POST or PUT requests.

|**Header**|**Example**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`Content-Type`|`Content-Type: text/html`|Used to describe the type of resource being transferred. The value is automatically added by the browsers on the client-side and returned in the server response. The `charset` field denotes the encoding standard, such as [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).|
|`Media-Type`|`Media-Type: application/pdf`|The `media-type` is similar to `Content-Type`, and describes the data being transferred. This header can play a crucial role in making the server interpret our input. The `charset` field may also be used with this header.|
|`Boundary`|`boundary="b4e4fbd93540"`|Acts as a marker to separate content when there is more than one in the same message. For example, within a form data, this boundary gets used as `--b4e4fbd93540` to separate different parts of the form.|
|`Content-Length`|`Content-Length: 385`|Holds the size of the entity being passed. This header is necessary as the server uses it to read data from the message body, and is automatically generated by the browser and tools like cURL.|
|`Content-Encoding`|`Content-Encoding: gzip`|Data can undergo multiple transformations before being passed. For example, large amounts of data can be compressed to reduce the message size. The type of encoding being used should be specified using the `Content-Encoding` header.|

---

## Request Headers

The client sends [Request Headers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) in an HTTP transaction. These headers are `used in an HTTP request and do not relate to the content` of the message. The following headers are commonly seen in HTTP requests.

|**Header**|**Example**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`Host`|`Host: www.inlanefreight.com`|Used to specify the host being queried for the resource. This can be a domain name or an IP address. HTTP servers can be configured to host different websites, which are revealed based on the hostname. This makes the host header an important enumeration target, as it can indicate the existence of other hosts on the target server.|
|`User-Agent`|`User-Agent: curl/7.77.0`|The `User-Agent` header is used to describe the client requesting resources. This header can reveal a lot about the client, such as the browser, its version, and the operating system.|
|`Referer`|`Referer: http://www.inlanefreight.com/`|Denotes where the current request is coming from. For example, clicking a link from Google search results would make `https://google.com` the referer. Trusting this header can be dangerous as it can be easily manipulated, leading to unintended consequences.|
|`Accept`|`Accept: */*`|The `Accept` header describes which media types the client can understand. It can contain multiple media types separated by commas. The `*/*` value signifies that all media types are accepted.|
|`Cookie`|`Cookie: PHPSESSID=b4e4fbd93540`|Contains cookie-value pairs in the format `name=value`. A [cookie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) is a piece of data stored on the client-side and on the server, which acts as an identifier. These are passed to the server per request, thus maintaining the client's access. Cookies can also serve other purposes, such as saving user preferences or session tracking. There can be multiple cookies in a single header separated by a semi-colon.|
|`Authorization`|`Authorization: BASIC cGFzc3dvcmQK`|Another method for the server to identify clients. After successful authentication, the server returns a token unique to the client. Unlike cookies, tokens are stored only on the client-side and retrieved by the server per request. There are multiple types of authentication types based on the webserver and application type used.|

A complete list of request headers and their usage can be found [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5).

## Response Headers

[Response Headers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6) can be `used in an HTTP response and do not relate to the content`. Certain response headers such as `Age`, `Location`, and `Server` are used to provide more context about the response. The following headers are commonly seen in HTTP responses.

|**Header**|**Example**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`Server`|`Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)`|Contains information about the HTTP server, which processed the request. It can be used to gain information about the server, such as its version, and enumerate it further.|
|`Set-Cookie`|`Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=b4e4fbd93540`|Contains the cookies needed for client identification. Browsers parse the cookies and store them for future requests. This header follows the same format as the `Cookie` request header.|
|`WWW-Authenticate`|`WWW-Authenticate: BASIC realm="localhost"`|Notifies the client about the type of authentication required to access the requested resource.|

---

## Security Headers

Finally, we have [Security Headers](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/). With the increase in the variety of browsers and web-based attacks, defining certain headers that enhanced security was necessary. HTTP Security headers are `a class of response headers used to specify certain rules and policies` to be followed by the browser while accessing the website.

|**Header**|**Example**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`Content-Security-Policy`|`Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'`|Dictates the website's policy towards externally injected resources. This could be JavaScript code as well as script resources. This header instructs the browser to accept resources only from certain trusted domains, hence preventing attacks such as [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).|
|`Strict-Transport-Security`|`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000`|Prevents the browser from accessing the website over the plaintext HTTP protocol, and forces all communication to be carried over the secure HTTPS protocol. This prevents attackers from sniffing web traffic and accessing protected information such as passwords or other sensitive data.|
|`Referrer-Policy`|`Referrer-Policy: origin`|Dictates whether the browser should include the value specified via the `Referer` header or not. It can help in avoiding disclosing sensitive URLs and information while browsing the website.|

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** This section only mentions a small subset of commonly seen HTTP headers. There are many other contextual headers that can be used in HTTP communications. It's also possible for applications to define custom headers based on their requirements. A complete list of standard HTTP headers can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers).


# Request Methods

The following are some of the commonly used methods:

|**Method**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`GET`|Requests a specific resource. Additional data can be passed to the server via query strings in the URL (e.g. `?param=value`).|
|`POST`|Sends data to the server. It can handle multiple types of input, such as text, PDFs, and other forms of binary data. This data is appended in the request body present after the headers. The POST method is commonly used when sending information (e.g. forms/logins) or uploading data to a website, such as images or documents.|
|`HEAD`|Requests the headers that would be returned if a GET request was made to the server. It doesn't return the request body and is usually made to check the response length before downloading resources.|
|`PUT`|Creates new resources on the server. Allowing this method without proper controls can lead to uploading malicious resources.|
|`DELETE`|Deletes an existing resource on the webserver. If not properly secured, can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) by deleting critical files on the web server.|
|`OPTIONS`|Returns information about the server, such as the methods accepted by it.|
|`PATCH`|Applies partial modifications to the resource at the specified location.|


# Response Codes

HTTP status codes are used to tell the client the status of their request. An HTTP server can return five types of response codes:

|**Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`1xx`|Provides information and does not affect the processing of the request.|
|`2xx`|Returned when a request succeeds.|
|`3xx`|Returned when the server redirects the client.|
|`4xx`|Signifies improper requests `from the client`. For example, requesting a resource that doesn't exist or requesting a bad format.|
|`5xx`|Returned when there is some problem `with the HTTP server` itself.|

The following are some of the commonly seen examples from each of the above HTTP method types:

|**Code**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`200 OK`|Returned on a successful request, and the response body usually contains the requested resource.|
|`302 Found`|Redirects the client to another URL. For example, redirecting the user to their dashboard after a successful login.|
|`400 Bad Request`|Returned on encountering malformed requests such as requests with missing line terminators.|
|`403 Forbidden`|Signifies that the client doesn't have appropriate access to the resource. It can also be returned when the server detects malicious input from the user.|
|`404 Not Found`|Returned when the client requests a resource that doesn't exist on the server.|
|`500 Internal Server Error`|Returned when the server cannot process the request.|

For a full list of standard HTTP response codes, you can visit this [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status). Apart from the standard HTTP codes, various servers and providers such as [Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003014432-HTTP-Status-Codes) or [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/APIError.html) implement their own codes.


## CRUD

As we can see, we can easily specify the table and the row we want to perform an operation on through such APIs. Then we may utilize different HTTP methods to perform different operations on that row. In general, APIs perform 4 main operations on the requested database entity:

|Operation|HTTP Method|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`Create`|`POST`|Adds the specified data to the database table|
|`Read`|`GET`|Reads the specified entity from the database table|
|`Update`|`PUT`|Updates the data of the specified database table|
|`Delete`|`DELETE`|Removes the specified row from the database table|

These four operations are mainly linked to the commonly known CRUD APIs, but the same principle is also used in REST APIs and several other types of APIs. Of course, not all APIs work in the same way, and the user access control will limit what actions we can perform and what results we can see. The [Introduction to Web Applications](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/75) module further explains these concepts, so you may refer to it for more details about APIs and their usage.
