![[Pasted image 20240513193124.png]]If we type `http://` instead of `https://` to visit a website that enforces HTTPS, the browser attempts to resolve the domain and redirects the user to the webserver hosting the target website. A request is sent to port `80` first, which is the unencrypted HTTP protocol. The server detects this and redirects the client to secure HTTPS port `443` instead. This is done via the `301 Moved Permanently` response code, which we will discuss in an upcoming section.

Next, the client (web browser) sends a "client hello" packet, giving information about itself. After this, the server replies with "server hello", followed by a [key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_exchange) to exchange SSL certificates. The client verifies the key/certificate and sends one of its own. After this, an encrypted [handshake](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake) is initiated to confirm whether the encryption and transfer are working correctly.

Once the handshake completes successfully, normal HTTP communication is continued, which is encrypted after that.
