FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, which is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another over a TCP-based network, such as the internet. FTP is commonly used for uploading and downloading files to and from a server, making it a popular tool for managing website files, software updates, and sharing large files with others.

FTP is capable of running in two different modes, `active` or `passive`. Active is the default operational method utilized by FTP, meaning that the server listens for a control command `PORT` from the client, stating what port to use for data transfer. Passive mode enables us to access FTP servers located behind firewalls or a NAT-enabled link that makes direct TCP connections impossible. In this instance, the client would send the `PASV` command and wait for a response from the server informing the client what IP and port to utilize for the data transfer channel connection.

#### FTP Commands

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`USER`|specifies the user to log in as.|
|`PASS`|sends the password for the user attempting to log in.|
|`PORT`|when in active mode, this will change the data port used.|
|`PASV`|switches the connection to the server from active mode to passive.|
|`LIST`|displays a list of the files in the current directory.|
|`CWD`|will change the current working directory to one specified.|
|`PWD`|prints out the directory you are currently working in.|
|`SIZE`|will return the size of a file specified.|
|`RETR`|retrieves the file from the FTP server.|
|`QUIT`|ends the session.|
This is not an exhaustive list of the possible FTP control commands that could be seen. These can vary based on the FTP application or shell in use. For more information on FTP, see [RFC 959 - File Transfer Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc959).
