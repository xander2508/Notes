An FTP bounce attack is a network attack that uses FTP servers to deliver outbound traffic to another device on the network. The attacker uses a `PORT` command to trick the FTP connection into running commands and getting information from a device other than the intended server.

Consider we are targetting an FTP Server `FTP_DMZ` exposed to the internet. Another device within the same network, `Internal_DMZ`, is not exposed to the internet. We can use the connection to the `FTP_DMZ` server to scan `Internal_DMZ` using the FTP Bounce attack and obtain information about the server's open ports. Then, we can use that information as part of our attack against the infrastructure.
