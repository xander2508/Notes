[SSH](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4251) is a secure protocol that can be used for secure host access, transfer of files, and general communication between network hosts. It provides a way to securely access hosts and services over insecure networks.

The well-known [OpenBSD SSH](https://www.openssh.com/) (`OpenSSH`) server on Linux distributions is an open-source fork of the original and commercial `SSH` server from SSH Communication Security. Accordingly, there are two competing protocols: `SSH-1` and `SSH-2`.

`SSH-2`, also known as SSH version 2, is a more advanced protocol than SSH version 1 in encryption, speed, stability, and security. For example, `SSH-1` is vulnerable to `MITM` attacks, whereas SSH-2 is not.

 In total, OpenSSH has six different authentication methods:

1. Password authentication
2. Public-key authentication
3. Host-based authentication
4. Keyboard authentication
5. Challenge-response authentication
6. GSSAPI authentication

1. If you need to access a remote service which is either internal to the victim or can only be accessed from the victims internal, see [[SSH Tunnelling]]
2. Attempt to brute force using [[Hydra]] or [[Crowbar]] once some information has been found, e.g. [[Common User Password Profiler (CUPP)]] or [[CEWL]]
3. Beware that password based authentication may be disabled and instead a key is required.
