[SSH](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4251) is a secure protocol that can be used for secure host access, transfer of files, and general communication between network hosts. It provides a way to securely access hosts and services over insecure networks.

`SSH-2`, also known as SSH version 2, is a more advanced protocol than SSH version 1 in encryption, speed, stability, and security. For example, `SSH-1` is vulnerable to `MITM` attacks, whereas SSH-2 is not.

 In total, OpenSSH has six different authentication methods:

1. Password authentication
2. Public-key authentication
3. Host-based authentication
4. Keyboard authentication
5. Challenge-response authentication
6. GSSAPI authentication

2. If you need to access a remote service which is either internal to the victim or can only be accessed from the victims internal, see [[SSH Tunnelling]]
3. Attempt to brute force using [[Hydra]] or [[Crowbar]] once some information has been found, e.g. [[CUPP]] or [[CEWL]]
