## Overview 

ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. It is used to map an IP address to a MAC address in a local network. When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same network, it uses ARP to find the MAC address of the intended recipient. This mapping is stored in an ARP table on each device for quick reference during communication.

In our network, hosts must know the physical address (MAC address) to which they must send their data. This need gave birth to ARP. Let's elucidate this with a step-by-step process.

| **Step** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1`      | Imagine our first computer, or Host A, needs to send data to our second computer, Host B. To achieve successful transmission, Host A must ascertain the physical address of Host B.                                                                            |
| `2`      | Host A begins by consulting its list of known addresses, the ARP cache, to check if it already possesses this physical address.                                                                                                                                |
| `3`      | In the event the address corresponding to the desired IP isn't in the ARP cache, Host A broadcasts an ARP request to all machines in the subnet, inquiring, "Who holds the IP x.x.x.x?"                                                                        |
| `4`      | Host B responds to this message with an ARP reply, "Hello, Host A, my IP is x.x.x.x and is mapped to MAC address aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa."                                                                                                                           |
| `5`      | On receiving this response, Host A updates its ARP cache with the new IP-to-MAC mapping.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `6`      | Occasionally, a host might install a new interface, or the IP address previously allocated to the host might expire, necessitating an update and remapping of the ARP cache. Such instances could introduce complications when we analyze our network traffic. |
