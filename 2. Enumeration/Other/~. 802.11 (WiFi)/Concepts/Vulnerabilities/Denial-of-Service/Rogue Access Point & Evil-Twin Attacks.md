Addressing rogue access points and evil-twin attacks can seem like a gargantuan task due to their often elusive nature. Nevertheless, with the appropriate strategies in place, these illegitimate access points can be detected and managed effectively.

##### Rogue Access Point

A rogue access point primarily serves as a tool to circumvent perimeter controls in place. An adversary might install such an access point to sidestep network controls and segmentation barriers, which could, in many cases, take the form of hotspots or tethered connections. These rogue points have even been known to infiltrate air-gapped networks. Their primary function is to provide unauthorized access to restricted sections of a network. The critical point to remember here is that rogue access points are directly connected to the network.


##### Evil-Twin

An evil-twin on the other hand is spun up by an attacker for many other different purposes. The key here, is that in most cases these access points are not connected to our network. Instead, they are standalone access points, which might have a web server or something else to act as a man-in-the-middle for wireless clients.

Attackers might set these up to harvest wireless or domain passwords among other pieces of information. Commonly, these attacks might also encompass a hostile portal attack.
