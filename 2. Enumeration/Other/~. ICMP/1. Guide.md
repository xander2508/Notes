[ICMP Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792)

[Internet Control Message Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) (`ICMP`) is a protocol used by devices to communicate with each other on the Internet for various purposes, including error reporting and status information. It sends requests and messages between devices, which can be used to report errors or provide status information.

#### ICMP Requests

A request is a message sent by one device to another to request information or perform a specific action. An example of a request in ICMP is the `ping` request, which tests the connectivity between two devices. When one device sends a ping request to another, the second device responds with a `ping reply` message.

#### ICMP Messages

A message in ICMP can be either a request or a reply. In addition to ping requests and responses, ICMP supports other types of messages, such as error messages, `destination unreachable`, and `time exceeded` messages. These messages are used to communicate various types of information and errors between devices on the network.

For example, if a device tries to send a packet to another device and the packet cannot be delivered, the device can use ICMP to send an error message back to the sender. ICMP has two different versions:

- `ICMPv4`: For IPv4 only
- `ICMPv6`: For IPv6 only

ICMPv4 is the original version of `ICMP`, developed for use with IPv4. It is still widely used and is the most common version of ICMP. On the other hand, ICMPv6 was developed for IPv6. It includes additional functionality and is designed to address some of the limitations of ICMPv4.

|**Request Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Echo Request`|This message tests whether a device is reachable on the network. When a device sends an echo request, it expects to receive an echo reply message. For example, the tools `tracert` (Windows) or `traceroute` (Linux) always send ICMP echo requests.|
|`Timestamp Request`|This message determines the time on a remote device.|
|`Address Mask Request`|This message is used to request the subnet mask of a device.|

| **Message Type**          | **Description**                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Echo reply`              | This message is sent in response to an echo request message.                                                                     |
| `Destination unreachable` | This message is sent when a device cannot deliver a packet to its destination.                                                   |
| `Redirect`                | A router sends this message to inform a device that it should send its packets to a different router.                            |
| `time exceeded`           | This message is sent when a packet has taken too long to reach its destination.                                                  |
| `Parameter problem`       | This message is sent when there is a problem with a packet's header.                                                             |
| `Source quench`           | This message is sent when a device receives packets too quickly and cannot keep up. It is used to slow down the flow of packets. |

Another crucial part of ICMP for us is the [Time-To-Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live) (`TTL`) field in the ICMP packet header that limits the packet's lifetime as it travels through the network. It prevents packets from circulating indefinitely on the network in the event of routing loops. Each time a packet passes through a router, the router decrements the `TTL value by 1`. When the TTL value reaches `0`, the router discards the packet and sends an ICMP `Time Exceeded` message back to the sender.

However, it is also possible to guess the operating system based on the default `TTL` value used by the device. Each operating system typically has a default `TTL` value when sending packets. This value is set in the packet's header and is decremented by 1 each time the packet passes through a router. Therefore, examining a device's default `TTL` value makes it possible to infer which operating system the device is using. For example: Windows systems (`2000/XP/2003/Vista/10`) typically have a default `TTL` value of 128, while macOS and Linux systems typically have a default `TTL` value of 64 and Solaris' default `TTL` value of 255. However, it is important to note that the user can change these values, so they should be independent of a definitive way to determine a device's operating system.
