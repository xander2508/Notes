1. Use a fuzzing tool to find all of the pages, see [[DirBuster]]
2. 

# Web Application Firewall (WAF)

If requests to pages or parameters changes based on what is sent, maybe there is a WAF blocking certain requests. Attempt to send " " or "", then "echo" etc

1. Burp can bypass WAF, see [[Burp#WAF Bypass]]
2. Get the server to make the requests on your behalf
	* [[XML#XML External Entity XXE Injection]]
	* [[Command Line Restrictions#Bypass Through Escalation]]
1. Vary the data sent to the parameter or page using blank spaces e.g. `/sync?opt=' pw''d'"`, see [HTB: FluxCapacitor | 0xdf hacks stuff](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2018/05/12/htb-fluxcapacitor.html)
2. Bash restrictions may be applying which restrict the commands to run, see [[Command Line Restrictions]]
# Website Features and their Vulnerabilities

## File upload 

1. Upload web shell, see [[3. Exploitation/Generic Tooling/Obtaining Remote Shells/1. Guide|Guide]]
	1. Secure hold by uploading a full shell, see [[Securing Access]]


### File Type Vulnerabilities

1. XML, in the case where a server uses an XML document to validate credentials
	* [[XML#XML External Entity XXE Injection]]

### Bypass File Upload Filtering

* [[File Upload Filtering Bypasses]]

## Command Input

Commands can be sent to the server either using a URL parameter or maybe a input box. 

1. Ensure a [[#Web Application Firewall (WAF)]] is not blocking the command by varying the data sent between valid and invalid, or just things that may be blocked.
2. Ensure that the machine has the program you are attempting to run installed, e.g. it may not have CURL
3. Bash restrictions may be applying which restrict the commands to run, see [[Command Line Restrictions]]
