1. Use at least **TWO** fuzzing tool to find all of the pages, see [[DirBuster]], [[GoBuster]] and [[DirSearch]] 
	* Ensure the hosts have been added to the `/etc/hosts` file and fuzz for sub domains, see [[wFuzz#Fuzzing Sub-Domains|wFuzz]]
2. Find out what the site is running, try [GitHub - tunetheweb/wappalyzer: Identify technology on websites.](https://github.com/tunetheweb/wappalyzer), or other methods for example [[NMAP]]
	* Check the application for open source config files which may help bypasses, e.g. GitHub
3. Ensure [[Burp]] is open and watch all requests.
4. Inputting any information, or visiting any interesting pages, check the request using [[Burp]] or just the inspect element. 
	* Importantly look for non-standard features like cookies, then poke them
	* Inputted information may be able to be manipulated
5. If browser based website viewing is failing, attempt using [[cURL]].
	* Some websites may require credentials but not request them 
6. If payloads are not working, try URL encoding for obscuration.

# Table of Concepts

1. If website responses change based on input, see [[Web Application Firewall (WAF)]]
2. File upload, see [[File Upload]]
3. If there is the ability to send commands to be run, see [[Command Injection]]
4. If the site can reflect the user input in any way, see [[Cross Site Scripting (XSS)]]
5. Inputs to password boxes or forms could lead to [[XML#XML External Entity XXE Injection|XXE]] or [[SQL Injection]]
6. Potential URI inputs can lead to [[File include]] or [[Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)]] 
7. If there is a template error, see [[Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)]], allows command injection.
8. If PHP Session cookie is used, see [[File include#PHP Session]]
9. If a link is found which should work but seems dead, maybe HTTPS on a HTTP port, see [[HTTP Versions]]
10. If Edge Side Include is found or hinted at, such as **ESIGate**, see [[Edge Side Include (ESI)]]
11. `.shtml` links to a possible general [[Server-Side Includes (SSI)]]
