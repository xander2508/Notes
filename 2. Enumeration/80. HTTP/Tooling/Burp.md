Describe the entrance of a catacomb vault door with a hand print in the centre, fantasy style

The catacomb vault door stood before them, ancient and foreboding. Made of weathered stone, intricate carvings adorned its surface, telling a story of times long past. At its center, a handprint was etched into the stone, glowing with an otherworldly light.

As they approached, the handprint seemed to pulsate with energy, beckoning them to place their hand upon it. With a sense of trepidation and wonder, they reached out and pressed their palm against the cold surface.

Suddenly, the door began to rumble and groan, slowly grinding open with a deafening noise. A gust of stale air rushed out from within, carrying with it the musty scent of ancient tombs. The darkness beyond seemed to stretch on forever, filled with shadows and mystery.

They hesitated for a moment before stepping through the threshold, knowing that they were about to embark on a journey into the unknown depths of the catacombs. But as they crossed over into the darkness, a sense of excitement and adventure filled their hearts, driving them forward into the unknown.
