Describe a majestic temple of light which is a bit run down, almost as if it has run out of magic

The temple of light stood tall and grand, its walls made of shimmering white marble that seemed to glow from within. The intricate carvings and designs on the pillars and archways sparkled in the sunlight, casting a rainbow of colors across the courtyard. But despite its once majestic appearance, the temple now appeared run down and worn, as if it had lost some of its magic over the years.

The once pristine marble walls were now chipped and weathered, covered in a layer of grime and dirt. The once vibrant stained glass windows were cracked and faded, their colours muted and dull. The once lush gardens that surrounded the temple were now overgrown with weeds and tangled vines, their flowers wilting and dying.

Inside, the air was thick with dust and cobwebs, the once bright torches now burnt out and covered in soot. The altar at the center of the temple was dusty and neglected, its golden ornaments tarnished and dull.

Despite its current state of disrepair, there was still a sense of power emanating from the temple. It was as if it still held some remnants of its former glory, waiting to be awakened once more. Perhaps all it needed was a spark of magic to bring it back to life, to restore it to its former beauty and majesty.
