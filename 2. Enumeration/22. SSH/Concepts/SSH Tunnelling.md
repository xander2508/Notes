Setting up an SSH tunnel allows you to securely access a remote server through an encrypted connection.
SSH tunnelling is commonly used for accessing private networks, bypassing firewalls, and encrypting internet traffic.
Once the tunnel is established, you can access services on the remote server as if they were running locally on your machine.
