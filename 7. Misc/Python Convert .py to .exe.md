Python Convert .py to .exe

# Python Convert .py to .exe

On a **Windows** host, install the following:
https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe

Obviously python 3 (not 3.8 since it's not supported) needs to be installed or python2.7. 

I got it working on Windows 10 with:
```
$ python2.7 get-pip.py
$ pip install auto-py-to-exe
$ auto-py-to-exe
```
