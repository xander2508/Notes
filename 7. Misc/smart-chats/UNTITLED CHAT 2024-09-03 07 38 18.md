Based on your notes, MySQL is an open-source SQL relational database management system (RDBMS) developed and supported by Oracle. It operates on the client-server principle, consisting of a MySQL server (the actual database management system responsible for data storage and distribution) and one or more MySQL clients. MySQL uses the SQL database language to control and manage data stored in tables with various columns, rows, and data types. The data is organized in a structured manner to facilitate easy use and retrieval, and it is often stored in files with the `.sql` extension. MySQL is known for its high performance and efficient data storage, making it suitable for handling large amounts of data.
