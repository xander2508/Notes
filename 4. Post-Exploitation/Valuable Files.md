# Guide

1. Old applications and their config files may have credentials 
2. Private key files
	* Usually within user home directories, under hidden folders .ssh etc, and running programs.
	* Use to privilege escalate or to traverse to a new machine
3. Bash or Command history of other users
4. Find any file edited or created by the current user
	* Linux: `find / -type f -user <USER> 2>/dev/null`
5. Watchout for password reuse and collect as many passwords as possible (even if you already have access to this level of privilege), see [[Linux Credential Hunting]] and [[Windows Credential Hunting]]
