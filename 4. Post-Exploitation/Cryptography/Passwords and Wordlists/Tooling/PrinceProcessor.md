`PRINCE` or `PRobability INfinite Chained Elements` is an efficient password guessing algorithm to improve password cracking rates. 

[Princeprocessor](https://github.com/hashcat/princeprocessor) is a tool that generates passwords using the PRINCE algorithm. 

The program takes in a wordlist and creates chains of words taken from this wordlist. For example, if a wordlist contains the words:

```txt
dog
cat
ball
```

```txt
dog
cat
ball
catcat
dogball
catball
balldog
dogdogdog
catdogdog
dogcatdog
<SNIP>
```

The `PRINCE` algorithm considers various permutation and combinations while creating each word. The binary can be download from the [releases](https://github.com/hashcat/princeprocessor/releases) page.

## Installation

```shell-session
wget https://github.com/hashcat/princeprocessor/releases/download/v0.22/princeprocessor-0.22.7z
```

```shell-session
7z x princeprocessor-0.22.7z
```

```shell-session
cd princeprocessor-0.22
```

```shell-session
./pp64.bin -h
```

## Usage

The "`--keyspace`" option can be used to find the number of combinations produced from the input wordlist.

```shell-session
./pp64.bin --keyspace < words

232
```


```shell-session
./pp64.bin -o wordlist.txt < words
```
