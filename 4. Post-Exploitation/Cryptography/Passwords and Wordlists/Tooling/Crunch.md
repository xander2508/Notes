Crunch can create wordlists based on parameters such as words of a specific length, a limited character set, or a certain pattern. It can generate both permutations and combinations.

[crunch | Kali Linux Tools](https://www.kali.org/tools/crunch/)


## Usage

```shell-session
crunch <minimum length> <maximum length> <charset> -t <pattern> -o <output file>
```

The "`-t`" option is used to specify the pattern for generated passwords. 

- `@` representing lower case characters
- `,` (comma) will insert upper case characters
- `%` will insert numbers 
- `^` will insert symbols

The command below creates a wordlist consisting of words with a length of 4 to 8 characters, using the default character set.

```shell-session
crunch 4 8 -o wordlist
```

The pattern "`ILFREIGHT201%@@@@`" will create words with the years 2010-2019 followed by four letters. The length here is 17, which is constant for all words.

```shell-session
crunch 17 17 -t ILFREIGHT201%@@@@ -o wordlist
```

If we know a user's birthdate is 10/03/1998 (through social media, etc.), we can include this in their password, followed by a string of letters. Crunch can be used to create a wordlist of such words. The "`-d`" option is used to specify the amount of repetition.

```shell-session
crunch 12 12 -t 10031998@@@@ -d 1 -o wordlist
```
