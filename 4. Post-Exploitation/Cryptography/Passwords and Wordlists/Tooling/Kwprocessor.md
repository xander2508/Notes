`Kwprocessor` is a tool that creates wordlists with keyboard walks.

[GitHub - hashcat/kwprocessor: Advanced keyboard-walk generator](https://github.com/hashcat/kwprocessor)

A common password generation technique is to follow patterns on the keyboard. These passwords are called keyboard walks, as they look like a walk along the keys. For example, the string "`qwertyasdfg`" is created by using the first five characters from the keyboard's first two rows. This seems complex to the normal eye but can be easily predicted.

## Installation

```shell-session
git clone https://github.com/hashcat/kwprocessor
```

```shell-session
cd kwprocessor
```

```shell-session
make
```

## Usage

The pattern is based on the geographical directions a user could choose on the keyboard. For example, the "`--keywalk-west`" option is used to specify movement towards the west from the base character. The program takes in base characters as a parameter, which is the character set the pattern will start with.

Next, it needs a keymap, which maps the locations of keys on language-specific keyboard layouts.

The final option is used to specify the route to be used. A route is a pattern to be followed by passwords. It defines how passwords will be formed, starting from the base characters. 

For example, the route 222 can denote the path 2 * EAST + 2 * SOUTH + 2 * WEST from the base character. If the base character is considered to be "`T`" then the password generated by the route would be "`TYUJNBV`" on a US keymap. 

For further information, refer to the [README](https://github.com/hashcat/kwprocessor#routes) for Kwprocessor.

```shell-session
kwp -s 1 basechars/full.base keymaps/en-us.keymap  routes/2-to-10-max-3-direction-changes.route
```

The command above generates words with characters reachable while holding shift (`-s`), using the full base, the standard en-us keymap, and 3 direction changes route.
