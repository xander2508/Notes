`Kwprocessor`Â is a tool that creates wordlists with keyboard walks.

[GitHub - hashcat/kwprocessor: Advanced keyboard-walk generator](https://github.com/hashcat/kwprocessor)

A common password generation technique is to follow patterns on the keyboard. These passwords are called keyboard walks, as they look like a walk along the keys. For example, the string "`qwertyasdfg`" is created by using the first five characters from the keyboard's first two rows. This seems complex to the normal eye but can be easily predicted.

## Installation

```shell-session
git clone https://github.com/hashcat/kwprocessor
```

```shell-session
cd kwprocessor
```

```shell-session
make
```
