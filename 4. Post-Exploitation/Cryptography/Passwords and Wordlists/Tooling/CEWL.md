# Description

The CEWL tool is a powerful command-line tool used for generating custom wordlists by crawling a target website or text file. It extracts words from the specified source and creates a list of unique words that can be used for various purposes, such as password cracking, penetration testing, or data analysis. 

With CEWL, users can customize the wordlist by setting parameters such as minimum word length, maximum word length, and excluding common words. This allows for the creation of targeted and specific wordlists tailored to the user's needs.

Overall, the CEWL tool is a valuable asset for cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and anyone looking to analyse text data or perform security assessments.
