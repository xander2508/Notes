## SNMP Community Strings

Often, when certain community strings are bound to specific IP addresses, they are named with the hostname of the host, and sometimes even symbols are added to these names to make them more challenging to identify. However, if we imagine an extensive network with over 100 different servers managed using SNMP, the labels, in that case, will have some pattern to them.
