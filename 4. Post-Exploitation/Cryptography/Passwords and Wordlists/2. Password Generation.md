Unfortunately, the tendency for users to create weak passwords also occurs despite the existence of password policies. Most people/employees follow the same rules when creating more complex passwords. Passwords are often created closely related to the service used. This means that many employees often select passwords that can have the company's name in the passwords. A person's preferences and interests also play a significant role. These can be pets, friends, sports, hobbies, and many other elements of life. `OSINT` information gathering can be very helpful for finding out more about a user's preferences and may assist with password guessing.

Commonly, users use the following additions for their password to fit the most common password policies:

| **Description**                        | **Password Syntax** |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| First letter is uppercase.             | `Password`          |
| Adding numbers.                        | `Password123`       |
| Adding year.                           | `Password2022`      |
| Adding month.                          | `Password02`        |
| Last character is an exclamation mark. | `Password2022!`     |
| Adding special characters.             | `P@ssw0rd2022!`     |

Based on statistics provided by [WPengine](https://wpengine.com/resources/passwords-unmasked-infographic/), most password lengths are `not longer` than `ten` characters.
