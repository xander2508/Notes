# Commands

* `hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 GetUserSPNs.out /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
* `hashcat -m 300 -a 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule --debug-mode=1 --debug-file=matched.rule`

# Rules Based Brute-Forcing

If a prospective password is known to be a variant of a specific pattern we can use rules to vary a known password.

Good rules for variation:

### IPMI

ModeÂ `7300`

In the event of an HP iLO using a factory default password, we can use this Hashcat mask attack command:
```
hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 -1 ?d?u
```

Otherwise:

```shell-session
hashcat -m 7300 -w 3 -O "HASH" /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
