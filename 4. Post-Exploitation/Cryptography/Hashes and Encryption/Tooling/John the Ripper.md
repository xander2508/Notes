[John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john) (`JTR` or `john`) is an essential pentesting tool used to check the strength of passwords and crack encrypted (or hashed) passwords using either brute force or dictionary attacks.

It is open-source software initially developed for UNIX-based systems and first released in 1996. It has become a staple of security professionals due to its various capabilities.

The "Jumbo" variant is recommended for those in the security field, as it has performance optimizations and additional features such as multilingual word lists and support for 64-bit architectures. This version is more effective in cracking passwords with greater accuracy and speed.
