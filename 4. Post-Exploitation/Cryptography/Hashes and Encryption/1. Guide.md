# Identify Hashes

1. [HashID](https://www.kali.org/tools/hashid/)
2. [[#Example Hashes]]

It is not always possible to identify the algorithm based on the obtained hash. Depending on the software, the plaintext might undergo multiple encryption rounds and salting transformations, making it harder to recover.

It is important to note that `hashid` uses regex to make a best-effort determination for the type of hash provided. Oftentimes `hashid` will provide many possibilities for a given hash, and we will still be left with a certain amount of guesswork to identify a given hash.

Knowing where a hash came from will greatly help us narrow down the hash type and, therefore, the `Hashcat` hash mode necessary to attempt to crack it. `Hashcat` provides an excellent [reference](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes), which maps hash modes to example hashes.
# Notes

1. If the algorithm used for the hashing is known, see [[Magic Hashes]]
2. If the hash starts with `0e` or `uncrackable`, see [[Magic Hashes]]
3. Ensure the hashes are correctly capitalised.
4. If the password is prepended with a secret value, and the hash is available, see [Hash Length Extension Attack](https://blog.skullsecurity.org/2012/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hash-length-extension-attacks)

# Generating Hashes

```
#!/bin/bash
input="/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/500-worst-passwords.txt"
while IFS= read -r line
do
  echo -n "$line" | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}'  >> newhash
  echo -n "$line" | md5sum | awk '{print $1}'  >> newhash
  echo -n "$line" | sha1sum | awk '{print $1}'  >> newhash
done < "$input"

input="newhash"
while IFS= read -r line
do
  echo ${line^^} >> newhash2
done < "$input"
```
