Microsoft's [Windows New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/ntlm-overview) is a set of security protocols that authenticates users' identities while also protecting the integrity and confidentiality of their data. NTLM is a single sign-on (SSO) solution that uses a challenge-response protocol to verify the user's identity without having them provide a password.

Despite its known flaws, NTLM is still commonly used to ensure compatibility with legacy clients and servers, even on modern systems. While Microsoft continues to support NTLM, Kerberos has taken over as the default authentication mechanism in Windows 2000 and subsequent Active Directory (AD) domains.

With NTLM, passwords stored on the server and domain controller are not "salted," which means that an adversary with a password hash can authenticate a session without knowing the original password. See [[Passing the Hash]].
# Guide

1. Example hash: ```
		`[Jason, :, 502, :, aad3c435b514a4eeaad3b935b51304fe, :, c46b9e588fa0d112de6f59fd6d58eae3, :, :, :] `
		
	* `Jason` is the user name
	- `502` is the relative identifier (500 is an administrator, 502 here is a Kerberos account.) [Kerberos Account](https://adsecurity.org/?p=483)
	- `aad3c435b514a4eeaad3b935b51304f` is the LM hash
	- `c46b9e588fa0d112de6f59fd6d58eae3` is the NT hash
