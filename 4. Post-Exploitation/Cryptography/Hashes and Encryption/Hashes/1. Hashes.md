Hashing is the process of converting some text to a string, which is unique to that particular text. Usually, a hash function always returns hashes with the same length irrespective of the type, length, or size of the data. Hashing is a one-way process, meaning there is no way of reconstructing the original plaintext from a hash.

A salt is a random piece of data added to the plaintext before hashing it. This increases the computation time but does not prevent brute force altogether.
## Example Hashes 

#### File Integrity 

- [[MD5]]
- [[SHA256]]
#### Password Storage

- [[PBKDF2]]
###### Unix:

- [[SHA512]]
- [[Blowfish]]
- [[BCrypt]]
- [[Argon2]]
#### Checksum

- [[HMAC]]
