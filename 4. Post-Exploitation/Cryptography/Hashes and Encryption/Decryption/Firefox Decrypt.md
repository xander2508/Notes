**Firefox Decrypt** is a tool to extract passwords from profiles of Mozilla (Fire/Water)fox™, Thunderbird®, SeaMonkey® and derivates.

It can be used to recover passwords from a profile protected by a Master Password as long as the latter is known. If a profile is not protected by a Master Password, passwords are displayed without prompt.

This tool does not try to crack or brute-force the Master Password in any way. If the Master Password is not known it will simply fail to recover any data.
