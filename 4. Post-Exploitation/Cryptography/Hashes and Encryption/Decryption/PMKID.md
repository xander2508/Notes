To perform PMKID cracking, we need to obtain the pmkid hash. The first step is extracting it from the capture (.cap) file using a tool such as `hcxpcaptool` from `hcxtools`. We can install `hcxtools` on Parrot using apt: `sudo apt install hcxtools`.

Note: This tool has since been replaced by `hcxpcapngtool` which we can compile and install directly from the [hcxtools GitHub repo](https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxtools).

Now we must use `hcxpcaptool` to extract the `pmkid` hash to run through `Hashcat`.

```shell-session
hcxpcaptool -z pmkidhash_corp cracking_pmkid.cap 
```

Alternatively, we can clone the `hcxtools` repo to our own VM, compile and install, and then follow similar steps with the tool `hcxpcapngtool`.

```shell-session
git clone https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxtools.git
```
```
cd hcxtools
```
```
make && make install
```

```shell-session
hcxpcapngtool cracking_pmkid.cap -o pmkidhash_corp2
```
