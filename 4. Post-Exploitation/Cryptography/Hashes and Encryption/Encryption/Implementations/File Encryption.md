## File Encryption on Windows 

Many different methods can be used to encrypt files and information on Windows systems. One of the simplest methods is the [Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/DRTools/4.0.2.3/Content/Functions%5CInvoke-AESEncryption.ps1) PowerShell script. This script is small and provides encryption of files and strings.

#### Import Module Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1

```powershell-session
Import-Module .\Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1
```

#### File Encryption Example

Using very `strong` and `unique` passwords for encryption for every company where a penetration test is performed is essential. This is to prevent sensitive files and information from being decrypted using one single password that may have been leaked and cracked by a third party.

```powershell-session
Invoke-AESEncryption -Mode Encrypt -Key "p4ssw0rd" -Path .\scan-results.txt
```


## File Encryption on Linux

[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is frequently included in Linux distributions, with sysadmins using it to generate security certificates, among other tasks. OpenSSL can be used to send files "nc style" to encrypt files.

To encrypt a file using `openssl` we can select different ciphers, see [OpenSSL man page](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/openssl-enc.html). Let's use `-aes256` as an example. We can also override the default iterations counts with the option `-iter 100000` and add the option `-pbkdf2` to use the Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 algorithm. When we hit enter, we'll need to provide a password.

#### Encrypting /etc/passwd with openssl

```shell-session
openssl enc -aes256 -iter 100000 -pbkdf2 -in /etc/passwd -out passwd.enc
```

#### Decrypt encrypted file

```shell-session
openssl enc -d -aes256 -iter 100000 -pbkdf2 -in passwd.enc -out passwd  
```
