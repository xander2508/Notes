# Description

Heartbleed is a serious security vulnerability found in the OpenSSL encryption software, which is commonly used to secure data transmission on the internet. This vulnerability allows attackers to access sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and even encryption keys, from the memory of servers running the affected version of OpenSSL.

The vulnerability was discovered in April 2014 and quickly became a major concern for website owners and internet users worldwide. It was estimated that around 17% of all secure web servers were affected by Heartbleed at the time of its discovery.

To exploit Heartbleed, attackers send specially crafted requests to servers vulnerable to the bug, tricking them into leaking sensitive information stored in their memory. This information could then be used to compromise user accounts, steal personal data, or launch further cyber attacks.

In response to the discovery of Heartbleed, many websites and organizations quickly patched their systems and urged users to change their passwords. The incident served as a wake-up call for the importance of regularly updating software and implementing strong cybersecurity measures to protect against such vulnerabilities.

Although Heartbleed has since been patched and is no longer as widespread a threat, it remains a cautionary tale about the potential risks of relying on outdated or insecure software for online security.
