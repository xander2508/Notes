1. Ensure all sources are crawled for credentials, see [[CEWL]]
2. If the password format is known, or the password is known to be common, see [[Hashcat#Rules Based Brute-Forcing|Hashcat]]

> [!NOTE]
> One caveat on password guessing is that you should consider the client's password policy. In many cases, a user account will be locked or disabled after a certain number of failed login attempts. In this case, we can perform a specific password guessing technique called `Password Spraying`.

## Attack Methods

#### Dictionary Attacks

Dictionary attacks involve using a pre-generated list of words and phrases (known as a dictionary) to attempt to crack a password. This list of words and phrases is often acquired from various sources, such as publicly available dictionaries, leaked passwords, or even purchased from specialized companies. The dictionary is then used to generate a series of strings which are then used to compare against the hashed passwords. If a match is found, the password is cracked, providing an attacker access to the system and the data stored within it. This type of attack is highly effective. Therefore, it is essential to take the necessary steps to ensure that passwords are kept secure, such as using complex and unique passwords, regularly changing them, and using two-factor authentication.

#### Brute Force Attacks

Brute force attacks involve attempting every conceivable combination of characters that could form a password. This is an extremely slow process, and using this method is typically only advisable if there are no other alternatives. It is also important to note that the longer and more complex the password, the more difficult it is to crack and the longer it will take to exhaust every combination. For this reason, it is highly recommended that passwords be at least 8 characters in length, with a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.

#### Rainbow Table Attacks

Rainbow table attacks involve using a pre-computed table of hashes and their corresponding plaintext passwords, which is a much faster method than a brute-force attack. However, this method is limited by the rainbow table size – the larger the table, the more passwords, and hashes it can store. Additionally, due to the nature of the attack, it is impossible to use rainbow tables to determine the plaintext of hashes not already included in the table. As a result, rainbow table attacks are only effective against hashes already present in the table, making the larger the table, the more successful the attack.
