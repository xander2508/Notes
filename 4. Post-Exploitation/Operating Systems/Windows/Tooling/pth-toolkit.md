A modified version of the passing-the-hash tool collection [https://code.google.com/p/passing-the-hash/](https://code.google.com/p/passing-the-hash/) designed to be portable and work straight out of the box even on the most 'bare bones' systems

[GitHub - byt3bl33d3r/pth-toolkit](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/pth-toolkit/tree/master)

## Usage

Use the full admin hash with `pth-winexe` to spawn a shell running as admin without needing to crack their password. 
Remember the full hash includes **both the LM and NTLM hash**, separated by a colon:

```
pth-winexe -U 'admin%hash' //10.10.181.132 cmd.exe
```
