Responding to these defensive advancements, attackers have developed a new approach that Mandiant labels as ["Bring Your Own Land" (BYOL)](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/bring-your-own-land-novel-red-teaming-technique). Instead of relying on the tools already present on a victim's system, threat actors and penetration testers emulating these tactics now employ .NET assemblies executed entirely in memory. This involves creating custom-built tools using languages like C#, rendering them independent of the pre-existing tools on the target system. The "Bring Your Own Land" lands is quite effective for the following reasons:

- Each Windows system comes equipped with a certain version of .NET pre-installed by default.
- A salient feature of .NET is its managed nature, alleviating the need for programmers to manually handle memory management. This attribute is part of the framework's managed code execution process, where the Common Language Runtime (CLR) takes responsibility for key system-level operations such as garbage collection, eliminating memory leaks and ensuring more efficient resource utilization.
- One of the intriguing advantages of using .NET assemblies is their ability to be loaded directly into memory. This means that an executable or DLL does not need to be written physically to the disk - instead, it is executed directly in memory. This behaviour minimizes the artifacts left behind on the system and can help bypass some forms of detection that rely on inspecting files written to disk.
- Microsoft has integrated a wide range of libraries into the .NET framework to address numerous common programming challenges. These libraries include functionalities for establishing HTTP connections, implementing cryptographic operations, and enabling inter-process communication (IPC), such as named pipes. These pre-built tools streamline the development process, reduce the likelihood of errors, and make it easier to build robust and efficient applications. Furthermore, for a threat actor, these rich features provide a toolkit for creating more sophisticated and covert attack methods.
A powerful illustration of this BYOL strategy is the ["execute-assembly"](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/blog/cobalt-strike-3-11-the-snake-that-eats-its-tail/) command implemented in CobaltStrike, a widely-used software platform for Adversary Simulations and Red Team Operations. CobaltStrike's 'execute-assembly' command allows the user to execute .NET assemblies directly from memory, making it an ideal tool for implementing a BYOL strategy.
