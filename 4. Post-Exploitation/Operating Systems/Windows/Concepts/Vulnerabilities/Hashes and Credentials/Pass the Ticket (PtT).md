In this attack, we use a stolen Kerberos ticket to move laterally instead of an NTLM password hash.

We need a valid Kerberos ticket to perform aÂ `Pass the Ticket (PtT)`. It can be:

- Service Ticket (TGS - Ticket Granting Service) to allow access to a particular resource.
- Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which we use to request service tickets to access any resource the user has privileges.

## Obtaining a Ticket 

Administer privileges are required to obtain all tickets.

On Windows, tickets are processed and stored by the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process. Therefore, to get a ticket from a Windows system, you must communicate with LSASS and request it. As a non-administrative user, you can only get your tickets, but as a local administrator, you can collect everything.
