A [Pass the Hash (PtH)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002/) attack is a technique where an attacker uses a password hash instead of the plain text password for authentication. The attacker doesn't need to decrypt the hash to obtain a plaintext password. PtH attacks exploit the authentication protocol, as the password hash remains static for every session until the password is changed.

`Restricted Admin Mode`, which is disabled by default, should be enabled on the target host; otherwise, you will be presented with the following error: 

"Account restrictions are preventing this user from signing in. for example: blank passwords aren't allowed, sign-in times are limited, or a policy restriction has been enforced"
