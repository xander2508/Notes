A [Pass the Hash (PtH)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002/) attack is a technique where an attacker uses a password hash instead of the plain text password for authentication. The attacker doesn't need to decrypt the hash to obtain a plaintext password. PtH attacks exploit the authentication protocol, as the password hash remains static for every session until the password is changed.

Use the full admin hash with pth-winexe to spawn a shell running as admin without needing to crack their password. 
Remember the full hash includes **both the LM and NTLM hash**, separated by a colon:

```
pth-winexe -U 'admin%hash' //10.10.181.132 cmd.exe
```
