User accounts are a way for personnel to access and use a host's resources. In certain circumstances, the system will also utilize a specially provisioned user account to perform actions. When thinking about accounts, we typically run into four different types:

- Service Accounts
- Built-in accounts
- Local users
- Domain users

See [[User Permissions]]
# Built-In Accounts

|**Account**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Administrator`|This account is used to accomplish administrative tasks on the local host.|
|`Default Account`|The default account is used by the system for running multi-user auth apps like the Xbox utility.|
|`Guest Account`|This account is a limited rights account that allows users without a normal user account to access the host. It is disabled by default and should stay that way.|
|`WDAGUtility Account`|This account is in place for the Defender Application Guard, which can sandbox application sessions.|
# Local vs. Domain Joined Users

`Domain` users differ from `local` users in that they are granted rights from the domain to access resources such as file servers, printers, intranet hosts, and other objects based on user and group membership. Domain user accounts can log in to any host in the domain, while the local user only has permission to access the specific host they were created on.

# User Groups 

To see what groups the current user is part of use `whoami /groups`

```powershell-session
Get-LocalGroup
```
