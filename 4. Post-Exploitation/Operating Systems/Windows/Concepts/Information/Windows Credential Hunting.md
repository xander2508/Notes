## Search Tools

1. With access to the GUI, it is worth attempting to use `Windows Search` to find files on the target using some of the keywords mentioned above.
2. [[The LaZagne Project]] will gather credentials from web browsers and installed applications.

## Commands 

Lists stored user names and passwords or credentials.

```
cmdkey /list

Keeping in mind common key terms, we can use variations of this command to discover credentials on a Windows target:

```cmd-session
findstr /SIM /C:"password" *.txt *.ini *.cfg *.config *.xml *.git *.ps1 *.yml
```
