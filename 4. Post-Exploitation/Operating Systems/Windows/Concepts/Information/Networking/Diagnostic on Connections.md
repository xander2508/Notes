The Test-NetConnection is a powerful cmdlet, capable of testing beyond basic network connectivity to determine whether we can reach another host. It can tell us about our TCP results, detailed metrics, route diagnostics and more. It would be worthwhile to look at this article by Microsoft onÂ [Test-NetConnection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/nettcpip/test-netconnection?view=windowsserver2022-ps).

```powershell-session
