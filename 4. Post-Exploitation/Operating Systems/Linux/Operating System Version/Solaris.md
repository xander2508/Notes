Solaris is widely used in enterprise environments for mission-critical applications, such as database management, cloud computing, and virtualization. For example, it includes a built-in hypervisor called `Oracle VM Server for SPARC`, which allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server. Overall, it is designed to handle large amounts of data and provide reliable and secure services to users and is often used in enterprise environments where security, performance, and stability are key requirements.

The goal of Solaris is to provide a highly stable, secure, and scalable platform for enterprise computing. It has built-in features for high availability, fault tolerance, and system management, making it ideal for mission-critical applications. It is widely used in the banking, finance, and government sectors, where security, reliability, and performance are paramount. It is also used in large-scale data centres, cloud computing environments, and virtualization platforms. Companies such as Amazon, IBM, and Dell use Solaris in their products and services, highlighting its importance in the industry.

Solaris uses a Service Management Facility (`SMF`), which is a highly advanced service management framework that provides better reliability and availability for system services.

In summary, the main differences can be grouped into the following categories:

- Filesystem
- Process management
- Package management
- Kernel and Hardware support
- System monitoring
- Security

# File System Hierarchy

|**Directory**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`/`|The root directory contains all other directories and files in the file system.|
|`/bin`|It contains essential system binaries that are required for booting and basic system operations.|
|`/boot`|The boot directory contains boot-related files such as boot loader and kernel images.|
|`/dev`|The dev directory contains device files that represent physical and logical devices attached to the system.|
|`/etc`|The etc directory contains system configuration files, such as system startup scripts and user authentication data.|
|`/home`|Users’ home directories.|
|`/kernel`|This directory contains kernel modules and other kernel-related files.|
|`/lib`|Directory for libraries required by the binaries in /bin and /sbin directories.|
|`/lost+found`|This directory is used by the file system consistency check and repair tool to store recovered files.|
|`/mnt`|Directory for mounting file systems temporarily.|
|`/opt`|This directory contains optional software packages that are installed on the system.|
|`/proc`|The proc directory provides a view into the system's process and kernel status as files.|
|`/sbin`|This directory contains system binaries required for system administration tasks.|
|`/tmp`|Temporary files created by the system and applications are stored in this directory.|
|`/usr`|The usr directory contains system-wide read-only data and programs, such as documentation, libraries, and executables.|
|`/var`|This directory contains variable data files, such as system logs, mail spools, and printer spools.|

# Commands 

## Uname

To display system information, including the version of Solaris, hardware type, and patch level: 

```
showrev -a
```


## Apt-get

Solaris, we need to use `pkgadd` to install packages like `SUNWapchr`.

```shell-session
pkgadd -d SUNWapchr
```

## Find 

Linux: 

```shell-session
find / -perm 4000
```

Solaris:

```shell-session
find / -perm -4000
```

## [[2. Enumeration/TCP/2049. Network File System (NFS)/1. Guide|Network File Share]]

In Solaris, the NFS server can be configured using the `share` command, which is used to share a directory over the network, and it also allows us to specify various options such as read/write permissions, access restrictions, and more. To share a directory over NFS in Solaris, we can use the following command:

```shell-session
$ share -F nfs -o rw /export/home
```

To mount a NFS share: 

```shell-session
mount -F nfs 10.129.15.122:/nfs_share /mnt/local
```

In Solaris, the configuration for NFS is stored in the `/etc/dfs/dfstab` file. This file contains entries for each shared directory, along with the various options for NFS sharing.

## lsof 

The `pfiles` command can be used to list all the files opened by a process. For example, to list all the files opened by the Apache web server process, we can use the following command:

```shell-session
pfiles `pgrep httpd`
```

## Strace

In Solaris, `truss` is used, which is a highly useful utility for developers and system administrators who need to debug complex software issues on the Solaris operating system. By tracing the system calls made by a process, `truss` can help identify the source of errors, performance issues, and other problems but can also reveal some sensitive information that may arise during application development or system maintenance.

```shell-session
sudo strace -p `pgrep apache2`
```

```shell-session
truss ls
```
