[Linikatz](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/linikatz) is a tool created by Cisco's security team for exploiting credentials on Linux machines when there is an integration with Active Directory. In other words, Linikatz brings a similar principle to `Mimikatz` to UNIX environments.

Just like [[Mimikatz]], to take advantage of Linikatz, we need to be root on the machine. This tool will extract all credentials, including Kerberos tickets, from different Kerberos implementations such as FreeIPA, SSSD, Samba, Vintella, etc. Once it extracts the credentials, it places them in a folder whose name starts with `linikatz.`. Inside this folder, you will find the credentials in the different available formats, including ccache and keytabs. These can be used, as appropriate, as explained above.

## Installation

```shell-session
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoCXSecurity/linikatz/master/linikatz.sh
```

## Usage

```shell-session
/opt/linikatz.sh
```
