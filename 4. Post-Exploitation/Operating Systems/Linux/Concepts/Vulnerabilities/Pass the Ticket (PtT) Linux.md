In this attack, we use a stolen Kerberos ticket to move laterally instead of an NTLM password hash.

We need a valid Kerberos ticket to perform a `Pass the Ticket (PtT)`. It can be:

- Service Ticket (TGS - Ticket Granting Service) to allow access to a particular resource.
- Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which we use to request service tickets to access any resource the user has privileges.

See [[Finding Kerberos Tickets in Linux]]

Most Linux attack tools that interact with Windows and Active Directory support Kerberos authentication. If we use them from a domain-joined machine, we need to ensure our `KRB5CCNAME` environment variable is set to the ccache file we want to use.
