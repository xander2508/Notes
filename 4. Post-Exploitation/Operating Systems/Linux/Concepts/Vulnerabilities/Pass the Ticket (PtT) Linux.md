In this attack, we use a stolen Kerberos ticket to move laterally instead of an NTLM password hash.

We need a valid Kerberos ticket to perform aÂ `Pass the Ticket (PtT)`. It can be:

- Service Ticket (TGS - Ticket Granting Service) to allow access to a particular resource.
- Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which we use to request service tickets to access any resource the user has privileges.
