## Identifying Group Membership with the `id` Command

We can see there are domain groups

```shell-session
id julio@inlanefreight.htb

uid=647401106(julio@inlanefreight.htb) gid=647400513(domain users@inlanefreight.htb) groups=647400513(domain users@inlanefreight.htb),647400512(domain admins@inlanefreight.htb),647400572(denied rodc password replication group@inlanefreight.htb)
```
## Check If Linux Machine is Domain Joined

We can identify if the Linux machine is domain joined using [realm](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/windows_integration_guide/cmd-realmd), a tool used to manage system enrolment in a domain and set which domain users or groups are allowed to access the local system resources.

```shell-session
realm list
```

In case [realm](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/windows_integration_guide/cmd-realmd) is not available, we can also look for other tools used to integrate Linux with Active Directory such as [sssd](https://sssd.io/) or [winbind](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/winbindd.8.html). See [How To Identify That The Linux Server Is Integrated With Active Directory (AD)? | 2DayGeek](https://www.2daygeek.com/how-to-identify-that-the-linux-server-is-integrated-with-active-directory-ad/)

```shell-session
ps -ef | grep -i "winbind\|sssd"
```
