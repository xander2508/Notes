As attackers, we may have several uses for a keytab file. The first thing we can do is impersonate a user using `kinit`. To use a keytab file, we need to know which user it was created for. `klist` is another application used to interact with Kerberos on Linux. 
#### Listing keytab File Information

This application reads information from a `keytab` file. Let's see that with the following command:

```shell-session
klist -k -t 
```

> [!NOTE]
> **kinit** is case-sensitive, so be sure to use the name of the principal as shown in klist. In this case, the username is lowercase, and the domain name is uppercase.

```shell-session
kinit carlos@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB -k -t /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab
```
