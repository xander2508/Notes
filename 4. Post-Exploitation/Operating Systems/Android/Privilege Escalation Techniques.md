# Advanced Privilege Escalation Techniques on Android

## Introduction
This document explores advanced methods for escalating privileges on Android devices by manipulating critical kernel data structures. The information is essential for security researchers and developers aiming to identify vulnerabilities, understand kernel internals, and enhance the overall security posture of Android systems.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Kernel Data Structures**
- **`task_struct`**: Represents each process in the kernel, managing states, identifiers, and memory.
- **`cred`**: Manages process credentials like user and group IDs, permissions, and capabilities.

### 2. **Security Mechanisms**
- **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)**:
  - Randomizes memory address allocation to thwart attacks.
- **Kernel ASLR (KASLR)**:
  - Extends ASLR to kernel memory for added protection.

### 3. **Tools and Techniques**
- **`pahole`**: Used to analyze kernel data structures and determine offsets.
- Exploitation involves leaking kernel memory and overwriting critical structures.

## Understanding Kernel Structures

### `task_struct`
- Central to process management.
- **Fields**:
  - **Process State**: Running, sleeping, stopped.
  - **Identifiers**: PID, TGID (Thread Group ID), COM (Executable Name).
  - **Memory Management**: Points to memory descriptors.
  - **File Descriptors**: Tracks open files and file system interactions.
  - **Parent-Child Relationships**: Links parent and child processes.
- **Impact**:
  - Direct modifications can elevate privileges or disrupt system functionality.

### `cred`
- Represents the security context of a process.
- **Fields**:
  - **User and Group IDs**:
    - UID, GID: User and Group IDs.
    - SUID, SGID: Saved IDs.
    - FSUID, FSGID: Filesystem IDs.
  - **Capabilities**:
    - **Inheritable**: Passed to child processes.
    - **Permitted**: Capabilities allowed for the process.
    - **Effective**: Capabilities actively in use.
    - **Bounding Set**: Upper limit of capabilities.
    - **Ambient**: Retains only necessary privileges.
  - **Security Context**:
    - Manages SELinux attributes and permissions.

## Privilege Escalation Techniques

### Steps:
1. **Memory Leak**:
   - Exploit vulnerabilities like buffer overflow to leak kernel addresses.
   - Use tools (e.g., `pahole`) to identify offsets of critical structures like `task_struct`.

2. **Modify `cred`**:
   - Locate `cred` within `task_struct`.
   - Overwrite `cred` fields to reflect root credentials:
     - Set all IDs (UID, GID) to 0.
     - Assign full capabilities (`0x3FFFFFFF`).

3. **Post-Exploitation**:
   - Perform actions such as:
     - Reading kernel memory.
     - Modifying system files.
     - Installing persistent backdoors.

## Security Features and Exploitation Bypasses

### Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Kernel ASLR (KASLR)
- **Purpose**:
  - ASLR: Randomizes user-space memory.
  - KASLR: Randomizes kernel memory addresses.
- **Exploitation**:
  - Leak kernel memory to determine offsets of structures like `task_struct` and `cred`.

### Using `pahole` for Kernel Analysis
- Extracts field sizes, offsets, and structure layouts.
- **Usage**:
```bash
  pahole -C task_struct vmlinux
```
- **Output**:
    - Provides the memory layout of `task_struct` and other structures.
    - Pinpoints offsets of critical fields for targeted modification.

## Practical Demonstration

### Environment Setup

- **Kernel Preparation**:
    
    - Compile Android kernel with debug symbols enabled.
    - Obtain `vmlinux` file containing Dwarf debugging information.
- **Tool Setup**:
    
    - Install `pahole` via `apt-get` or build from source.

### Exploitation Steps

1. **Leak Kernel Address**:
    - Use an arbitrary read-write vulnerability to identify `task_struct`.
2. **Identify `cred`**:
    - Use `pahole` to locate `cred` within `task_struct`.
    - Calculate offsets to fields like UID, GID, and capabilities.
3. **Modify Credentials**:
    - Overwrite `cred` structure to match `init_cred` (root credentials):
        - Set IDs (UID, GID, etc.) to 0.
        - Assign capabilities (`0x3FFFFFFF`) to achieve full system access.
4. **Post-Exploitation**:
    - Utilize root access for:
        - Accessing kernel memory.
        - Altering system configurations.
        - Establishing persistence.

## Detailed Analysis of `cred` Structure

### Fields Overview:

- **User and Group Identifiers**:
    - UID, GID, SUID, SGID, FSUID, FSGID.
- **Capabilities**:
    - **Inheritable**: Limits child process capabilities.
    - **Permitted**: Defines potential capabilities.
    - **Effective**: Specifies active capabilities.
    - **Bounding Set**: Restricts maximum privileges.
    - **Ambient**: Retains essential permissions.

### Practical Manipulation:

- Overwrite fields to disable security mechanisms:
    - All IDs to `0`.
    - Capabilities (`0x3FFFFFFF`) for unrestricted access.
- Reference `init_cred` values for accurate replacement.

## Advanced Security Considerations

### SELinux Bypass

- Requires additional modifications to handle SELinux policies.
- Analyze `SELinux` fields within `cred` structure.
- Implement bypass strategies tailored to device-specific configurations.
