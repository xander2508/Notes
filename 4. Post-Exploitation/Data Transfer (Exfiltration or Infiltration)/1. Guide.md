Keep in mind this is noisy because you will have web requests entering and leaving your network along with file reads and writes, so it `WILL` leave logs. If your transfers are done locally, only host to host, for example, you only leave logs on those hosts, which are a bit harder to sift through and leave less of a trace since we aren't writing ingress/egress logs at the customer boundary.
