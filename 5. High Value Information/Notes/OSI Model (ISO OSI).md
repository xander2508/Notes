## ISO/OSI vs. TCP/IP

`TCP/IP` is a communication protocol that allows hosts to connect to the Internet. It refers to the `Transmission Control Protocol` used in and by applications on the Internet. In contrast to `OSI`, it allows a lightening of the rules that must be followed, provided that general guidelines are followed.

`OSI`, on the other hand, is a communication gateway between the network and end-users. The OSI model is usually referred to as the reference model because it is newer and more widely used. It is also known for its strict protocol and limitations.
