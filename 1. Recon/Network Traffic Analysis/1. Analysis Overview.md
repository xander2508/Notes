Traffic analysis is not an exact science. NTA can be a very dynamic process and is not a direct loop. It is greatly influenced by what we are looking for (network errors vs. malicious actions) and where we have visibility into our network. Performing traffic analysis can distil down to a few basic tenants.

## Tricks and Tips

1. Servers typically communicate over the well-known port number assigned to the protocolÂ `(80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, for example)`. Hosts or recipients in the conversations will typically utilize a random high port number.
2. Attackers like to hide transmissions in UDP as it is less monitored. 
3. DNS uses both TCP and UDP, see [[2. Enumeration/TCP/53. Domain Name System (DNS)/1. Guide|DNS guide]]
4. List unique hosts.
5. Filter any irrelevant traffic.
6. Wi-Fi see, [[Wi-Fi Capture]]

## Key Components of an Effective Analysis

#### 1. Know your environment

There are several key components to perform traffic analysis effectively. First, know the environment. If we are unsure if a host belongs in the network, how can we determine if it is rogue or not? Keeping asset inventories and network maps is vital. These will aid in the analysis process.

#### 2. Placement is Key

Next, the placement of our host for capturing traffic is a critical thing. Closest to the source of the issue is the ideal placement of our capturing tool. If the traffic in question is coming from the internet, listening to the inbound links is a great way to see the complete picture. It is as close to the source as we, the administrators, can get. If the problem seems to be isolated to one host on our internal network, try placing the capture tools in the same segment as the problem host and see what traffic is happening within the segment.

#### 3. Persistence

Persistence is the next critical component for us. The issue will not always be easy to spot. It may not even be a frequent event on the network. For example, an attacker's Command and Control server reaching out to the victim's computers may only happen on a time interval of once every several hours, or even once a day or less. This means that if we did not catch it the first time around, it might be a while before it appears in our logs. Don't lose the drive to find the problem. It could mean the difference between stopping the attacker and a full-scale breach like a ransomware attack.
