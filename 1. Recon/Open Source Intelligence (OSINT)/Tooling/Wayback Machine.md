`The Wayback Machine`Â is a digital archive of the World Wide Web and other information on the Internet. Founded by the Internet Archive, a non-profit organization, it has been archiving websites since 1996.

It allows users to "go back in time" and view snapshots of websites as they appeared at various points in their history. These snapshots, known as captures or archives, provide a glimpse into the past versions of a website, including its design, content, and functionality.

### How Does the Wayback Machine Work?

The Wayback Machine operates by using web crawlers to capture snapshots of websites at regular intervals automatically. These crawlers navigate through the web, following links and indexing pages, much like how search engine crawlers work. However, instead of simply indexing the information for search purposes, the Wayback Machine stores the entire content of the pages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other resources.

The frequency with which the Wayback Machine archives a website varies. Some websites might be archived multiple times a day, while others might only have a few snapshots spread out over several years. Factors that influence this frequency include the website's popularity, its rate of change, and the resources available to the Internet Archive.

It's important to note that the Wayback Machine does not capture every single webpage online. It prioritizes websites deemed to be of cultural, historical, or research value. Additionally, website owners can request that their content be excluded from the Wayback Machine, although this is not always guaranteed.
