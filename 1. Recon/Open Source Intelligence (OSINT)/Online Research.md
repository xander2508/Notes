## Guidance 

Google Dorks can be used to specify the target and gain insight on not commonly viewed pages.

### Google Dorks 

One of the easiest and most used is Google search combined with Google Dorks. For example, we can use the Google Dorks `inurl:` and `intext:` to narrow our search to specific terms.

### Website Internals

The internal website can be reviewed and have its information extracted:

- Employees 
- Utilised technologies
- Infrastructure 
- Company industry and its ties (e.g. A software design company will probably have a Dev server)

### DNS Lookup 

See [[2. Enumeration/TCP/53. Domain Name System (DNS)/1. Guide#DNS Reverse Lookups/Queries|Guide]]
## Specific Notes

1. Company's main website and the type of business may inform on the type of internal network or the devices on the network. Web server, mobile phones etc
	1. The website's SSL [[CRT (Certificate Files)]] and using [[CRT (Certificate Files)#Search Public CRT Files]]
