Searching for and identifying employees on social media platforms can also reveal a lot about the teams' infrastructure and makeup. This, in turn, can lead to us identifying which technologies, programming languages, and even software applications are being used. 

To a large extent, we will also be able to assess each person's focus based on their skills. The posts and material shared with others are also a great indicator of what the person is currently engaged in and what that person currently feels is important to share with others.

### Identifying Employees

1.  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) 
2. [Xing](https://www.xing.de/)
### Job Postings 

Job postings from companies can also tell us a lot about their infrastructure and give us clues about what we should be looking for.

From a job post we can see which programming languages are preferred: `Java, C#, C++, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl`. We can all see the required  databases, such as: `PostgreSQL, Mysql, and Oracle`. In addition, we can know that different frameworks are used for web application development, such as: `Flask, Django, ASP.NET, Spring`. This expands for all the software which may be posted in a job application e.g. Atlassian vs GitLab. 

Anything which gives us an over view on the company.
