OSINT is a process for finding publicly available information on a target company or individuals that allows the identification of events (i.e., public and private meetings), external and internal dependencies, and connections. OSINT uses public (Open-Source) information from freely available sources to obtain the desired results. We can often find security-relevant and sensitive information from companies and their employees. Usually, the people who share such information are unaware that they are not the only ones who can access it.

It is possible to find highly sensitive information such as passwords, hashes, keys, tokens, and much more that can give us access to the network within just a few minutes. Repositories on sites like [Github](https://github.com/) or other development platforms are often not set up correctly, and external viewers can see this information. If this type of sensitive information is found at the onset of testing, the Incident Handling and Report section of the [[Rules of Engagement|RoE]] should describe the procedure for reporting these types of critical security vulnerabilities. Publicly published passwords or SSH keys represent a critical security gap if they have not already been removed or changed. Therefore, our client's administrator must review this information before we proceed.

Developers often share whole sections of code on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to show other developers a better overview of how their code works to help them solve their problems. This type of information can also be found very quickly and used against the company. Our task is to find such security holes and have them closed.
