[Nessus Essentials](https://community.tenable.com/s/article/Nessus-Essentials) by Tenable is the free version of the official Nessus Vulnerability Scanner. Individuals can access Nessus Essentials to get started understanding Tenable's vulnerability scanner. The caveat is that it can only be used for up to 16 hosts. The features in the free version are limited but are perfect for someone looking to get started with Nessus. The free scanner will attempt to identify vulnerabilities in an environment.

Nessus also supports credentialed scanning and provides a lot of flexibility by supporting LM/NTLM hashes, Kerberos authentication, and password authentication.

Credentials can be configured for host-based authentication via SSH with a password, public key, certificate, or Kerberos-based authentication. It can also be configured for Windows host-based authentication with a password, Kerberos, LM hash, or NTLM hash:
## Installation

To download Nessus, we can navigate to its [Download Page](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true) to download the correct Nessus binary for our system.

Next, we can visit the [Activation Code Page](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/activation-code) to request a Nessus Activation Code, which is necessary to get the free version of Nessus.

```shell-session
dpkg -i Nessus-8.15.1-ubuntu910_amd64.deb
```

## Usage

```shell-session
sudo systemctl start nessusd.service
```

Navigate to `https://localhost:8834`

### New Scan

A new Nessus scan can be configured by clicking `New Scan`, and selecting a scan type. Scan templates fall into three categories: `Discovery`, `Vulnerabilities`, and `Compliance`.

A description of each scan type can be found [here](https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/ScanAndPolicyTemplates.htm).

## Information
### Scan Policies

Nessus gives us the option to create scan policies. Essentially these are customized scans that allow us to define specific scan options, save the policy configuration, and have them available to us under `Scan Templates` when creating a new scan. This gives us the ability to create targeted scans for any number of scenarios, such as a slower, more evasive scan, a web-focused scan, or a scan for a particular client using one or several sets of credentials. Scan policies can be imported from other Nessus scanners or exported to be later imported into another Nessus scanner.
#### Creating a Scan Policy

To create a scan policy, we can click on the `New Policy` button in the top right, and we will be presented with the list of pre-configured scans. We can choose a scan, such as the `Basic Network Scan`, then customize it, or we can create our own.
### Nessus Plugins

Nessus works with plugins written in the [Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nessus_Attack_Scripting_Language) and can target new vulnerabilities and CVEs. These plugins contain information such as the vulnerability name, impact, remediation, and a way to test for the presence of a particular issue.

Plugins are rated by severity level: `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, `Info`. At the time of this writing Tenable has published `145,973` plugins that cover `58,391` CVE IDs and `30,696` [Bugtraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugtraq) IDs. A searchable database of all published plugins is on the [Tenable website](https://www.tenable.com/plugins).

The `Plugins` tab provides more information on a particular detection, including mitigation. When conducting recurring scans, there may be a vulnerability/detection that, upon further examination, is not considered to be an issue.

### Nessus Reports

Once a scan is completed we can choose to export a report in `.pdf`, `.html`, or `.csv` formats. The .pdf and .html reports give the option for either an Executive Summary or a custom report. The Executive Summary report provides a listing of hosts, a total number of vulnerabilities discovered per host, and a `Show Details` option to see the severity, CVSS score, plugin number, and name of each discovered issue. The plugin number contains a link to the full plugin writeup from the Tenable plugin database. The PDF option provides the scan results in a format that is easier to share. The CSV report option allows us to select which columns we would like to export. This is particularly useful if importing the scan results into another tool such as Splunk if a document needs to be shared with many internal stakeholders responsible for remediation of the various assets scanned or to perform analytics on the scan data.
### Exporting Nessus Scans

Nessus also gives the option to export scans into two formats `Nessus (scan.nessus)` or `Nessus DB (scan.db)`. The `.nessus` file is an `.xml` file and includes a copy of the scan settings and plugin outputs. The `.db` file contains the `.nessus` file and the scan's KB, plugin Audit Trail, and any scan attachments. More information about the `KB` and `Audit Trail` can be found [here](https://community.tenable.com/s/article/What-is-included-in-a-nessus-db-file).

Scripts such as the [nessus-report-downloader](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eelsivart/nessus-report-downloader/master/nessus6-report-downloader.rb) can be used to quickly download scan results in all available formats from the CLI using the Nessus REST API

## Mitigating Issues

Some firewalls will cause us to receive scan results showing either all ports open or no ports open. If this happens, a quick fix is often to configure an Advanced Scan and disable the `Ping the remote host` option. This will stop the scan from using ICMP to verify that the host is "live" and instead proceed with the scan. Some firewalls may return an "ICMP Unreachable" message that Nessus will interpret as a live host and provide many false-positive informational findings.

In sensitive networks, we can use rate-limiting to minimize impact. For example, we can adjust `Performance Options` and modify `Max Concurrent Checks Per Host` if the target host is often under heavy load, such as a widely used web application. This will limit the number of plugins used concurrently against the host.

We can avoid scanning legacy systems and choose the option not to scan printers, as we showed in an earlier section. If a host is of particular concern, it should be left out of the target scope or we can use the `nessusd.rules` file to configure Nessus scans. More information about it you can find [here](https://community.tenable.com/s/article/What-is-the-Nessus-rules-file?language=en_US).

Finally, unless specifically requested, we should never perform [Denial of Service checks](https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/families/Denial%20of%20Service). We can ensure that these types of plugins are not used by always enabling the ["safe checks"](https://www.tenable.com/blog/understanding-the-nessus-safe-checks-option) option when performing scans to avoid any network plugins that can have a negative impact on a target, such as crashing a network daemon. Enabling the "safe checks" option does not guarantee that a Nessus vulnerability scan will have zero adverse impact but will significantly minimize potential impact and decrease scanning time.

It is always best to communicate with our clients or internal stakeholders and alert necessary personnel before starting a scan. When the scan is completed, we should keep detailed logs of the scanning activity in case an incident occurs that must be investigated.
