Vulnerability scanning is often part of a standard penetration test, but the two are not the same. A vulnerability scan can help gain additional coverage during a penetration test or speed up the project's testing under time constraints. An actual penetration test includes much more than just a scan.

The type of scans run varies from one tool to another, but most tools `run a combination of dynamic and static tests`, depending on the target and the vulnerability. A `static test` would determine a vulnerability if the identified version of a particular asset has a public CVE. However, this is not always accurate as a patch may have been applied, or the target isn't specifically vulnerable to that CVE. On the other hand, a `dynamic test` tries specific (usually benign) payloads such as weak credentials, SQL injection, or command injection on the target (i.e., a web application). If any payload returns a hit, then there's a good chance that it is vulnerable.
