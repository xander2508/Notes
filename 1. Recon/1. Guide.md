1. Add the target IP to the `/etc/host` file
	1. Add any found host names for recon as well
2. Start a notebook and write down evidence of all found, including dead ends
3. Run [[AutoRecon]] then [[NmapAutomator]]
4. Start bruteforcing early and just leave it running


# Notes 

1. Verify which subnet is configured for the network
