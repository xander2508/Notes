Start with `standard protocols first` and work our way into the `austere and specific` only to the organization.
- Most attacks will come from the internet, so it has to access the internal net somehow. This means there will be traffic generated and logs written about it.
- HTTP/S, FTP, E-mail, and basic TCP and UDP traffic will be the most common things seen coming from the world. Start at these and clear out anything that is not necessary to the investigation.
- After these, check standard protocols that allow for communications between networks, such as SSH, RDP, or Telnet. When looking for these types of anomalies, be mindful of the security policy of the network. Does our organization's security plan and implementations allow for RDP sessions that are initiated outside the enterprise? What about the use of Telnet?

Look for `patterns`. Is a specific host or set of hosts checking in with something on the internet at the same time daily? This is a typical Command and Control profile setup that can easily be spotted by looking for patterns in our traffic data.
