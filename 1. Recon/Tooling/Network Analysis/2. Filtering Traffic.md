While performing our analysis, we are also looking to see what the trends look like within the traffic and determine if it matches a baseline of typical operational traffic.

Utilizing data analysis tools such as the top talkers' module in Wireshark can help identify hosts that may be sending a large amount of data. We can check this against the host's normal baseline to determine if it is out of character.

Another way could be to look at connections between internal hosts or common and uncommon ports.
