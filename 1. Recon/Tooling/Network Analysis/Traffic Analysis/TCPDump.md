[TCPDump](https://www.tcpdump.org/) is a command-line utility that, with the aid of LibPcap, captures and interprets network traffic from a network interface or capture file. 

It was built for use on any Unix-like operating system and had a Windows twin called `WinDump`. It is a potent and straightforward tool used on most Unix-based systems. It does not require a GUI and can be used through any terminal or remote connection, such as SSH.


# Usage

```
tcpdump -i any -w log.pcap
```
