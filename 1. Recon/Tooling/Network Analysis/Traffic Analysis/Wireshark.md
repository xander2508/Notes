[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) is a graphical network traffic analyzer. It captures and decodes frames off the wire and allows for an in-depth look into the environment. It can run many different dissectors against the traffic to characterize the protocols and applications and provide insight into what is happening.

If the GUI is not accessible see [[TShark]]

## Guide

1. Is there an authentication sequence present, see [[Wireshark#Authentication Sequence|Authentication Sequence]]

### Authentication Sequence

1. Identify the application
2. Locate username
3. Locate hash
4. Locate any additional nonces etc


## Installing Wireshark

```shell-session
sudo apt install wireshark 
```

1. Packet List: `Orange`
    - In this window, we see a summary line of each packet that includes the fields listed below by default. We can add or remove columns to change what information is presented.
        - Number- Order the packet arrived in Wireshark
        - Time- Unix time format
        - Source- Source IP
        - Destination- Destination IP
        - Protocol- The protocol used (TCP, UDP, DNS, ETC.)
        - Information- Information about the packet. This field can vary based on the type of protocol used within. It will show, for example, what type of query It is for a DNS packet.
2. Packet Details: `Blue`
    - The Packet Details window allows us to drill down into the packet to inspect the protocols with greater detail. It will break it down into chunks that we would expect following the typical OSI Model reference. `The packet is dissected into different encapsulation layers for inspection.`
    - Keep in mind, Wireshark will show this encapsulation in reverse order with lower layer encapsulation at the top of the window and higher levels at the bottom.
3. Packet Bytes: `Green`
    - The Packet Bytes window allows us to look at the packet contents in ASCII or hex output. As we select a field from the windows above, it will be highlighted in the Packet Bytes window and show us where that bit or byte falls within the overall packet.
    - This is a great way to validate that what we see in the Details pane is accurate and the interpretation Wireshark made matches the packet output.
    - Each line in the output contains the data offset, sixteen hexadecimal bytes, and sixteen ASCII bytes. Non-printable bytes are replaced with a period in the ASCII format.
