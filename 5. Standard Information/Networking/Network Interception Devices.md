| `Network Taps`          | Taps ([Gigamon](https://www.gigamon.com/), [Niagra-taps](https://www.niagaranetworks.com/products/network-tap)) are devices capable of taking copies of network traffic and sending them to another place for analysis. These can be in-line or out of band. They can actively capture and analyze the traffic directly or passively by putting the original packet back on the wire as if nothing had changed. |

| `Networking Span Ports` | [Span Ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_mirroring) are a way to copy frames from layer two or three networking devices during egress or ingress processing and send them to a collection point. Often a port is mirrored to send those copies to a log server.                                                                                                                                          |
