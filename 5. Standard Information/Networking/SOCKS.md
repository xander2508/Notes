SOCKS stands for `Socket Secure`, a protocol that helps communicate with servers where you have firewall restrictions in place. Unlike most cases where you would initiate a connection to connect to a service, in the case of SOCKS, the initial traffic is generated by a SOCKS client, which connects to the SOCKS server controlled by the user who wants to access a service on the client-side. Once the connection is established, network traffic can be routed through the SOCKS server on behalf of the connected client.

One more benefit of using SOCKS proxy for pivoting and forwarding data is that SOCKS proxies can pivot via creating a route to an external server from `NAT networks`. SOCKS proxies are currently of two types: `SOCKS4` and `SOCKS5`. SOCKS4 doesn't provide any authentication and UDP support, whereas SOCKS5 does provide that.
