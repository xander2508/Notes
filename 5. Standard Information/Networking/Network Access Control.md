NAC is a security system that ensures that only authorized and compliant devices are granted access to the network, preventing unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.

The following are the different NAC technologies that can be used to enhance security measures:

- Discretionary access control (DAC)
- Mandatory access control (MAC)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
