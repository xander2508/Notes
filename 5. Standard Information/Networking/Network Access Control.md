NAC is a security system that ensures that only authorized and compliant devices are granted access to the network, preventing unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.

The following are the different NAC technologies that can be used to enhance security measures:

- Discretionary access control (DAC)
- Mandatory access control (MAC)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

## Discretionary Access Control

Â It is a widely used access control system that enables users to manage access to their resources by granting resource owners the responsibility of controlling access permissions to their resources. This means that users and groups who own a specific resource can decide who has access to their resources and what actions they are authorized to perform. These permissions can be set for reading, writing, executing, or deleting the resource.
## Mandatory Access Control
