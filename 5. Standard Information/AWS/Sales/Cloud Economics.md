Cloud economics focuses on two areas that are different from each other but also have much in common: business value and cloud financial management.

The first area, business value, includes all the components that advance your customers’ businesses. Business value is what you discuss with your customers before a sale to help them understand the value of AWS, and how AWS will improve all aspects of their business’s performance and customer experience.

Cloud financial management is the other part of cloud economics. This area focuses on helping AWS customers be successful in financially managing their cloud infrastructure. Cloud financial management helps customers develop the skills and tools necessary to realize the full economic benefit of the cloud through their AWS journey.
