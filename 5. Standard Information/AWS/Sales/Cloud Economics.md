Cloud economics focuses on two areas that are different from each other but also have much in common: business value and cloud financial management.

The first area, business value, includes all the components that advance your customers’ businesses. Business value is what you discuss with your customers before a sale to help them understand the value of AWS, and how AWS will improve all aspects of their business’s performance and customer experience.

Cloud financial management is the other part of cloud economics. This area focuses on helping AWS customers be successful in financially managing their cloud infrastructure. Cloud financial management helps customers develop the skills and tools necessary to realize the full economic benefit of the cloud through their AWS journey.

The framework is composed of five pillars: cost savings, staff productivity, operational resilience, business agility, and sustainability.
The value is delivered through activities like proofs of concept, architectural reviews, migration of workloads, and so on. The business value analysis facilitates progressing to these later activities.

- Cost savings is realized by avoiding the on-premises infrastructures with large fixed spend and reducing the ongoing variable spend through the economies of scale that AWS offers.
- Staff productivity is measured in increased output by the same size team because much of their previous tactical work is no longer needed.
- Operational resilience is achieved by enhanced availability, more security, and less downtime.
- Business agility consists of the new products, new geo location expansions, or more features of the existing products that your customers can now deliver.
- And, sustainability is reducing the environmental impact of IT operations.
