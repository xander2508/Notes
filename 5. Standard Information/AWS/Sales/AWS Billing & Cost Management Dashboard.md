## Consolidated Billing

[[AWS Organizations]] also provides the option for [**consolidated billing**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidated-billing.html).

The consolidated billing feature of AWS Organizations enables you to receive a single bill for all AWS accounts in your organization. By consolidating, you can easily track the combined costs of all the linked accounts in your organization. The default maximum number of accounts allowed for an organization is 4, but you can contact AWS Support to increase your quota, if needed.

All accounts can receive the hourly cost benefit of the Reserved Instances.

For billing purposes, AWS treats all of the accounts in the organization as if they were one account. Some services, such as AWS Data Transfer and Amazon S3, have volume pricing tiers across certain usage dimensions that give you lower prices the more you use the service. With consolidated billing, AWS combines the usage from all accounts to determine which volume pricing tiers to apply, giving you a lower overall price whenever possible. AWS then allocates each member account a portion of the overall volume discount based on the account's usage.
## AWS Budgets

In [**AWS Budgets**](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets), you can create budgets to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations.

The information in AWS Budgets updates three times a day. This helps you to accurately determine how close your usage is to your budgeted amounts or to the AWS Free Tier limits.

In AWS Budgets, you can also set custom alerts when your usage exceeds (or is forecasted to exceed) the budgeted amount.


## AWS Cost Explorer

[**AWS Cost Explorer**](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) is a tool that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report of the costs and usage for your top five cost-accruing AWS services. You can apply custom filters and groups to analyse your data. For example, you can view resource usage at the hourly level.

## **AWS Support**

AWS offers four different [**Support plans**](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/) to help you troubleshoot issues, lower costs, and efficiently use AWS services.
