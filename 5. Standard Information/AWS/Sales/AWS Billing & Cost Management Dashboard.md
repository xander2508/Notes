## Consolidated Billing

[[AWS Organizations]] also provides the option for [**consolidated billing**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidated-billing.html).

The consolidated billing feature of AWS Organizations enables you to receive a single bill for all AWS accounts in your organization. By consolidating, you can easily track the combined costs of all the linked accounts in your organization. The default maximum number of accounts allowed for an organization is 4, but you can contact AWS Support to increase your quota, if needed.

## AWS Budgets

In [**AWS Budgets**](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets), you can create budgets to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations.

The information in AWS Budgets updates three times a day. This helps you to accurately determine how close your usage is to your budgeted amounts or to the AWS Free Tier limits.

In AWS Budgets, you can also set custom alerts when your usage exceeds (or is forecasted to exceed) the budgeted amount.


## AWS Cost Explorer

[**AWS Cost Explorer**](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) is a tool that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report of the costs and usage for your top five cost-accruing AWS services. You can apply custom filters and groups to analyze your data. For example, you can view resource usage at the hourly level.
