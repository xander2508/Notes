AWS CAF organises guidance into six areas of focus called perspectives. AWS CAF helps to uncover existing gaps an organization might have and gets it to a stage of readiness.

Each perspective is used to create work streams that uncover gaps in existing skills and processes which are recorded as inputs.

AWS CAF assists in visualizing the future state of your customer’s organization. It can help identify and strategically address any readiness gaps to ensure your customer’s business is well-prepared for cloud migration

AWS provides seven common approaches, which include: refactor, replatform, repurchase, rehost, relocate, retain, and retire. Because each application is unique, enterprises often use multiple strategies for separate applications.

#### Relocate

Relocate means to move applications or workloads to the cloud with minimal downtime and without any change to your existing operations or technical stack.

A common use case for this migration scenario is to quickly relocated to AWS using the infrastructure that’s most familiar to your customer. A relocate strategy would be the fastest method to use in this type of scenario.
#### Rehost

"lift and shift"

In this approach, applications or workloads are migrated to AWS without any changes to the underlying operating system or application stack. Customers can use lift and shift strategy to quickly migrate, and then focus on application modernization. After the application is in the cloud, it will be more convenient to get to a cloud optimized state.

#### Replatform
