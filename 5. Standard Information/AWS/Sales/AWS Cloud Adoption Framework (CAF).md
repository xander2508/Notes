AWS CAF organises guidance into six areas of focus called perspectives.

Each perspective is used to create work streams that uncover gaps in existing skills and processes which are recorded as inputs.

AWS CAF assists in visualizing the future state of your customer’s organization. It can help identify and strategically address any readiness gaps to ensure your customer’s business is well-prepared for cloud migration
