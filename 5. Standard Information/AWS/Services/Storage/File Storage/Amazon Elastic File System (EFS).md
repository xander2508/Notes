Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) is a set-and-forget file system that automatically grows and shrinks as you add and remove files. There is no need for provisioning or managing storage capacity and performance.

With the Amazon EFS simple web interface, you can create and configure file systems quickly without any minimum fee or setup cost. You pay only for the storage used and you can choose from a range of storage classes designed to fit your use case.
