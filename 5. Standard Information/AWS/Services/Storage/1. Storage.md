AWS storage services are grouped into three categories: file storage, block storage, and object storage. In file storage, data is stored as files in a hierarchy. In block storage, data is stored in fixed-size blocks. And in object storage, data is stored as objects in buckets.

## File storage  

File storage is ideal when you require centralized access to files that must be easily shared and managed by multiple host computers. Typically, this storage is mounted onto multiple hosts, and requires file locking and integration with existing file system communication protocols.

## Block storage  

File storage treats files as a singular unit, but block storage splits files into fixed-size chunks of data called blocks that have their own addresses. Each block is an individual piece of data storage. Because each block is addressable, blocks can be retrieved efficiently. Think of block storage as a more direct route to access the data.  
  
When data is requested, the addresses are used by the storage system to organize the blocks in the correct order to form a complete file to present back to the requestor. Besides the address, no additional metadata is associated with each block.
