DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database that provides fast, consistent performance at any scale. 

It has a flexible billing model, tight integration with infrastructure as code (IaC), and a hands-off operational model. 

DynamoDB has become the database of choice for two categories of applications: high-scale applications and serverless applications. 

Although DynamoDB is the database of choice for high-scale and serverless applications, it can work for nearly all online transaction processing (OLTP) application workloads.
