[Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift)Â is a data warehousing service that you can use for big data analytics. It offers the ability to collect data from many sources and helps you to understand relationships and trends across your data.

Once data becomes too complex to handle with traditional relational databases, you've entered the world of data warehouses. Data warehouses are engineered specifically for this kind of big data, where you are looking at historical analytics as opposed to operational analysis.

It's massively scalable. Redshift nodes in multiple petabyte sizes is very common. In fact, in cooperation with Amazon Redshift Spectrum, you can directly run a single SQL query against exabytes of unstructured data running in data lakes.

Amazon Redshift uses SQL to analyse structured and semi-structured data across data warehouses, operational databases, and data lakes, using AWS-designed hardware and machine learning to deliver the best price performance at any scale.
