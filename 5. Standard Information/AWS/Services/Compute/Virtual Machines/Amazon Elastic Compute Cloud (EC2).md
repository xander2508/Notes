Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. With this service, you can provision virtual servers called EC2 instances.

With Amazon EC2, you can do the following:

- Provision and launch one or more EC2 instances in minutes.
- Stop or shut down EC2 instances when you finish running a workload.
- Pay by the hour or second for each instance type (minimum of 60 seconds).

To create an EC2 instance, you must define the following:
- **Hardware specifications:** CPU, memory, network, and storage
- **Logical configurations:** Networking location, firewall rules, authentication, and the operating system of your choice

# Amazon Machine Image 

When launching an EC2 instance, the first setting you configure is which operating system you want by selecting an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

In the AWS Cloud, the operating system installation is not your responsibility. Instead, it's built into the AMI that you choose.

An AMI includes the operating system, storage mapping, architecture type, launch permissions, and any additional preinstalled software applications.
