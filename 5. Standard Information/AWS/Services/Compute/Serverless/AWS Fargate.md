AWS Fargate is a purpose-built serverless compute engine for containers. AWS Fargate scales and manages the infrastructure, so developers can work on what they do best, application development. It achieves this by allocating the right amount of compute. This eliminates the need to choose and manage EC2 instances, cluster capacity, and scaling. Fargate supports both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS architecture and provides workload isolation and improved security by design.

Fargate abstracts the EC2 instance so that youâ€™re not required to manage the underlying compute infrastructure. However, with Fargate, you can use all the same Amazon ECS concepts, APIs, and AWS integrations. It natively integrates with IAM and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud ([[Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)]]). With native integration with Amazon VPC, you can launch Fargate containers inside your network and control connectivity to your applications.
