  
If you want to deploy your workloads and applications without having to manage any EC2 instances or containers, you can use Lambda.

Lambda runs your code on a high availability compute infrastructure and requires no administration from the user. You upload your source code in one of the languages that Lambda supports, and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. There are no servers to manage. You get continuous scaling with sub second metering and consistent performance.
