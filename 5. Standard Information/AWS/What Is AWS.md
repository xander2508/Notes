Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centres and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Six advantages of cloud computing

#### Pay-as-you-go

The cloud computing model is based on paying only for the resources that you use. This is in contrast to on-premises models of investing in data centres and hardware that might not be fully used.

#### Benefit from massive economies of scale

By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices. See [[Regions]].

#### Stop guessing capacity

Stop guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision before deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes notice.

#### Increase speed and agility

IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make resources available to developers from weeks to minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, because the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.

#### Realize cost savings

Companies can focus on projects that differentiate their business and remove the "undifferentiated heavy lifting", instead of maintaining data centres. With cloud computing, you can focus on your customers, rather than racking, stacking, and powering physical infrastructure.

#### Go global in minutes

Applications can be deployed in multiple Regions around the world with a few clicks. This means that you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at a minimal cost.
