A virtual private cloud (VPC) is an isolated network that you create in the AWS Cloud, similar to a traditional network in a data center. When you create an Amazon VPC, you must choose three main factors:

- Name of the VPC
- Region where the VPC will live â€“ A VPC spans all the Availability Zones within the selected Region.
- IP range for the VPC in CIDR notation

## Creating a subnet  

After you create your VPC, you must create subnets inside the network. In AWS, subnets are used to provide high availability and connectivity options for your resources. Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet and a private subnet for resources that won't be connected to the internet.
