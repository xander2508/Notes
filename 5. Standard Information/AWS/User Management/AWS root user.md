When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that were used to create the account.

### AWS root user credentials

The AWS root user has two sets of credentials associated with it. One set of credentials is the email address and password that were used to create the account. This allows you to access the AWS Management Console. The second set of credentials is called access keys, which allow you to make programmatic requests from the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or AWS API.  
  
Access keys consist of two parts:

- **Access key ID:** for example,`A2lAl5EXAMPLE`
- **Secret access key:** for example, `wJalrFE/KbEKxE`
