[Tasks That Require Root User Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html)

### Authentication

When you create your AWS account, you use the combination of an email address and a password to verify your identity. If a user types in the correct email address and password, the system assumes the user is allowed to enter and grants them access. This is the process of authentication.  
  
Authentication ensures that the user is who they say they are. User names and passwords are the most common types of authentication. But you might also work with other forms, such as token-based authentication or biometric data, like a fingerprint. Authentication simply answers the question, “Are you who you say you are?”
