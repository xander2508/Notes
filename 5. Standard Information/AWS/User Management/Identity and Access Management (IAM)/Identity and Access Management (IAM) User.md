An IAM user represents a person or service that interacts with AWS. You define the user in your AWS account. Any activity done by that user is billed to your account. When you create a user, that user can sign in to gain access to the AWS resources inside your account.

You can also add more users to your account as needed. Each person should have their own login credentials to prevent sharing credentials between users.
