Regions are geographic locations worldwide where AWS hosts its data centers. AWS Regions are named after the location where they reside. For example, in the United States, the Region in Northern Virginia is called the Northern Virginia Region, and the Region in Oregon is called the Oregon Region. AWS has Regions in Asia Pacific, China, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and South America. And we continue to expand to meet our customers' needs.

Each AWS Region is associated with a geographical name and a Region code.

Here are examples of Region codes:

- **us-east-1** is the first Region created in the eastern US area. The geographical name for this Region is N. Virginia.
- **ap-northeast-1** is the first Region created in the northeast Asia Pacific area. The geographical name for this Region is Tokyo.

  
AWS Regions are independent from one another. Without explicit customer consent and authorization, data is not replicated from one Region to another. When you decide which AWS Region to host your applications and workloads, consider four main aspects: latency, price, service availability, and compliance.
