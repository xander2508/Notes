When an organization of any kind, in any industry, and of any size needs to plan their cybersecurity strategy, they should start by creating an inventory of their `data assets`. If you want to protect something, you must first know what you are protecting! Once assets have been inventoried, then you can start the process of `asset management`. This is a key concept in defensive security.

#### Asset Inventory

`Asset inventory` is a critical component of vulnerability management. An organization needs to understand what assets are in its network to provide the proper protection and set up appropriate defenses. The asset inventory should include information technology, operational technology, physical, software, mobile, and development assets. Organizations can utilize asset management tools to keep track of assets. The assets should have data classifications to ensure adequate security and access controls.

#### Application and System Inventory

An organization should create a thorough and complete inventory of data assets for proper asset management for defensive security. Data assets include:

- All data stored on-premises. HDDs and SSDs in endpoints (PCs and mobile devices), HDDs & SSDs in servers, external drives in the local network, optical media (DVDs, Blu-ray discs, CDs), flash media (USB sticks, SD cards). Legacy technology may include floppy disks, ZIP drives (a relic from the 1990s), and tape drives.
    
- All of the data storage that their cloud provider possesses. [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (`AWS`), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (`GCP`), and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) are some of the most popular cloud providers, but there are many more. Sometimes corporate networks are "multi-cloud," meaning they have more than one cloud provider. A company's cloud provider will provide tools that can be used to inventory all of the data stored by that particular cloud provider.
    
- All data stored within various `Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)` applications. This data is also "in the cloud" but might not all be within the scope of a corporate cloud provider account. These are often consumer services or the "business" version of those services. Think of online services such as `Google Drive`, `Dropbox`, `Microsoft Teams`, `Apple iCloud`, `Adobe Creative Suite`, `Microsoft Office 365`, `Google Docs`, and the list goes on.
    
- All of the applications a company needs to use to conduct their usual operation and business. Including applications that are deployed locally and applications that are deployed through the cloud or are otherwise Software-as-a-Service.
    
- All of a company's on-premises computer networking devices. These include but aren't limited to `routers`, `firewalls`, `hubs`, `switches`, dedicated `intrusion detection` and `prevention systems` (`IDS/IPS`), `data loss prevention` (`DLP`) systems, and so on.
    

All of these assets are very important. A threat actor or any other sort of risk to any of these assets can do significant damage to a company's information security and ability to operate day by day. An organization needs to take its time to assess everything and be careful not to miss a single data asset, or they won't be able to protect it.

Organizations frequently add or remove computers, data storage, cloud server capacity, or other data assets. Whenever data assets are added or removed, this must be thoroughly noted in the `data asset inventory`.
