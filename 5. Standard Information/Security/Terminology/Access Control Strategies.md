NAC is a security system that ensures that only authorized and compliant devices are granted access to the network, preventing unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.

The following are the different NAC technologies that can be used to enhance security measures:

- Discretionary access control (DAC)
- Mandatory access control (MAC)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

## Discretionary Access Control

Â It is a widely used access control system that enables users to manage access to their resources by granting resource owners the responsibility of controlling access permissions to their resources. This means that users and groups who own a specific resource can decide who has access to their resources and what actions they are authorized to perform. These permissions can be set for reading, writing, executing, or deleting the resource.
## Mandatory Access Control

Each resource is assigned a security label that identifies its security level, and each user or process is assigned a security clearance that identifies its security level. Access to a resource is only granted if the user's or process's security level is equal to or greater than the security level of the resource. MAC is often used in operating systems and applications that require a high level of security, such as military or government systems, financial systems, and healthcare systems. MAC systems are designed to prevent unauthorized access to resources and minimize the impact of security breaches.

## Role-based Access Control

Users are assigned roles based on their job responsibilities or other criteria, and each role is granted a set of permissions that determine the actions they can perform. Resource access is granted based on the user's assigned role rather than their identity or ownership of the resource. RBAC systems are typically used in environments with many users and resources, such as large organizations, government agencies, and financial institutions.
