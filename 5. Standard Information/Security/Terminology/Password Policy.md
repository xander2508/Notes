A [password policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_policy) is a set of rules designed to enhance computer security by encouraging users to employ strong passwords and use them adequately based on the company's definition. The scope of a password policy is not limited to the password minimum requirements but the whole life cycle of a password (such as manipulation, storage, and transmission).

## Password Policy Standards

Because of compliance and best practices, many companies use [IT security standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_security_standards). Although complying with a standard does not mean that we are 100% secure, it is a common practice within the industry that defines a baseline of security controls for organizations. That should not be the only way to measure the effectiveness of the organizational security controls.

Some security standards include a section for password policies or password guidelines. Here is a list of the most common:

1. [NIST SP800-63B](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63b.pdf)
2. [CIS Password Policy Guide](https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/white-papers/cis-password-policy-guide)
3. [PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss)

We can use those standards to understand different perspectives of password policies. After that, we can use this information to create our password policy.

## Enforcing Password Policy

A password policy is a guide that defines how we should create, manipulate and store passwords in the organization. To apply this guide, we need to enforce it, using the technology at our disposal or acquiring what needs to make this work. Most applications and identity managers provide methods to apply our password policy.

For example, if we use Active Directory for authentication, we need to configure an [Active Directory Password Policy GPO](https://activedirectorypro.com/how-to-configure-a-domain-password-policy/), to enforce our users to comply with our password policy.

Once the technical aspect is covered, we need to communicate the policy to the company and create processes and procedures to guarantee that our password policy is applied everywhere.
