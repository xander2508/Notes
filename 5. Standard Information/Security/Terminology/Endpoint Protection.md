`Endpoint protection` refers to any localized device or service whose sole purpose is to protect a single host on the network. The host can be a personal computer, a corporate workstation, or a server in a network's De-Militarized Zone (`DMZ`).

Endpoint protection usually comes in the form of software packs which include `Antivirus Protection`, `Antimalware Protection` (this includes bloatware, spyware, adware, scareware, ransomware), `Firewall`, and `Anti-DDOS` all in one, under the same software package. We are better familiarized with this form than the latter, as most of us are running endpoint protection software on our PCs at home or the workstations at our workplace. Avast, Nod32, Malwarebytes, and BitDefender are just some current names.
