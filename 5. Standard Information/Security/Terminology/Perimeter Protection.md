`Perimeter protection` usually comes in physical or virtualized devices on the network perimeter edge. These `edge devices` themselves provide access `inside` of the network from the `outside`, in other terms, from `public` to `private`.

Between these two zones, on some occasions, we will also find a third one, called the De-Militarized Zone (`DMZ`), which was mentioned previously. This is a `lower-security policy level` zone than the `inside networks'` one, but with a higher `trust level` than the `outside zone`, which is the vast Internet. This is the virtual space where public-facing servers are housed, which push and pull data for public clients from the Internet but are also managed from the inside and updated with patches, information, and other data to keep the served information up to date and satisfy the customers of the servers.
