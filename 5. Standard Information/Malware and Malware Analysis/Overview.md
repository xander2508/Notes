`Malware`, short for malicious software, is a term encompassing various types of software designed to infiltrate, exploit, or damage computer systems, networks, and data.

## Malware Types

- `Viruses`: A computer virus is a type of malware that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code into those programs. If this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected" with a computer virus, a metaphor derived from biological viruses.
- `Worms`: Worms are autonomous malware capable of multiplying across networks without needing human intervention.
- `Trojans`: Also known as Trojan Horses, these are disguised as genuine software to trick users into running them.
- `Ransomware`: This malicious type of malware encrypts files on the target's system, making them unreachable. Attackers then demand a ransom in return for the decryption key, effectively holding the victim's data to ransom.
- `Spyware`: This type of malware stealthily gathers sensitive data and user activities without their consent.
- `Adware`: It shows uninvited and invasive advertisements on infected systems, often resulting in a poor user experience.
- `Botnets`: These are networks of compromised devices, often referred to as bots or zombies, controlled by a central command-and-control (C2) server.
- `Rootkits`: These are stealthy forms of malware designed to gain unauthorized access and control over the fundamental components (the "root") of an operating system. They alter system functions to conceal their presence, making them extremely challenging to spot and eliminate.
- `Backdoors/RATs (Remote Access Trojans)`: Backdoors and RATs are crafted to offer unauthorized access and control over compromised systems from remote locations.
- `Droppers`: These are a kind of malware used to transport and install extra malicious payloads onto infected systems. They serve as a conduit for other malware, ensuring the covert installation and execution of more sophisticated threats.
- `Information Stealers`: These are tailored to target and extract sensitive data, like login credentials, personal information, or intellectual property, for harmful purposes.

## Malware Samples

- [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/): This website allows us to submit files for malware analysis. However, they also have a public feed of their analyses, where malware samples are often shared.
- [TheZoo](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo): A GitHub repository that contains a collection of live malware for analysis and education. The repository also contains additional information about each sample, such as its family and the type of activities it performs.
- [Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net](https://malware-traffic-analysis.net/): This website provides traffic analysis exercises that can be extremely beneficial for people trying to learn about malware traffic patterns. They often provide pcap files of actual malware traffic, which can be quite informative.
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/): VirusTotal inspects items with over 70 antivirus scanners and URL/domain blocklisting services, in addition to a myriad of tools to extract signals from the studied content. Any user can select a file from their computer using their browser and send it to VirusTotal. VirusTotal offers a number of file submission methods, including the primary public web interface, desktop uploaders, browser extensions and a programmatic API.
- [ANY.RUN](https://app.any.run/): An interactive online sandbox for malware analysis. The service allows researchers to analyse malware behaviour by running samples in a controlled environment. While it offers both free and paid tiers, even the free version provides access to public submissions, which can include various malware samples.
- [Contagio Malware Dump](https://contagiodump.blogspot.com/): Contagio Dump is a collection of malware samples, threat reports, and related resources curated by a malware researcher named Mila. The site provides direct, anonymized access to an extensive range of malware samples, including various types of trojans, worms, ransomware, and exploits. It's frequently used by security researchers and analysts to study malware behaviour and develop mitigation techniques.
- [VX Underground](https://www.vx-underground.org/): VX-Underground is one of the largest collections of malware source code, articles, and papers on the internet. It aims to collect, preserve, and share all kinds of materials related to malware, exploit, and hacking culture. This resource is valuable to security researchers and enthusiasts who want to study malware construction and behaviour from a more technical and code-centric perspective.
## Malware/Evidence Acquisition

### Disk Imaging Solutions

- [FTK Imager](https://www.exterro.com/ftk-imager): Developed by AccessData (now acquired by Exterro), FTK Imager is one of the most widely used disk imaging tools in the cybersecurity field. It allows us to create perfect copies (or images) of computer disks for analysis, preserving the integrity of the evidence. It also lets us view and analyze the contents of data storage devices without altering the data.
- [OSFClone](https://www.osforensics.com/tools/create-disk-images.html): A free, open-source utility designed for the task of creating and cloning forensic disk images. It's easy to use and supports a wide variety of file systems.
- `DD and DCFLDD`: Both are command-line utilities available on Unix-based systems (including Linux and MacOS). DD is a versatile tool included in most Unix-based systems by default, while DCFLDD is an enhanced version of DD with features specifically useful for forensics, such as hashing.

### Memory Acquisition Solutions

- [DumpIt](https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/magnet-dumpit-for-windows/): A simplistic utility that generates a physical memory dump of Windows and Linux machines. On Windows, it concatenates 32-bit and 64-bit system physical memory into a single output file, making it extremely easy to use.
- [MemDump](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html): MemDump is a free, straightforward command-line utility that enables us to capture the contents of a system's RAM. Itâ€™s quite beneficial in forensics investigations or when analysing a system for malicious activity. Its simplicity and ease of use make it a popular choice for memory acquisition.
- [Belkasoft RAM Capturer](https://belkasoft.com/ram-capturer): This is another powerful tool we can use for memory acquisition, provided free of charge by Belkasoft. It can capture the RAM of a running Windows computer, even if there's active anti-debugging or anti-dumping protection. This makes it a highly effective tool for extracting as much data as possible during a live forensics investigation.
- [Magnet RAM Capture](https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/magnet-ram-capture/): Developed by Magnet Forensics, this tool provides a free and simple way to capture the volatile memory of a system.
- [LiME (Linux Memory Extractor)](https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME): LiME is a Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) which allows the acquisition of volatile memory. LiME is unique in that it's designed to be transparent to the target system, evading many common anti-forensic measures.

### Other Evidence Acquisition Solutions

- [KAPE (Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor)](https://www.kroll.com/en/services/cyber-risk/incident-response-litigation-support/kroll-artifact-parser-extractor-kape): KAPE is a triage program designed to help in collecting and parsing artifacts in a quick and effective manner. It focuses on targeted collection, reducing the volume of collected data and the time required for analysis. KAPE is free for use and is an essential tool in our digital forensics toolkit.
