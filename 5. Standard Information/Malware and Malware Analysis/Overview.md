`Malware`, short for malicious software, is a term encompassing various types of software designed to infiltrate, exploit, or damage computer systems, networks, and data.

## Malware Types

- `Viruses`
- `Worms`: Worms are autonomous malware capable of multiplying across networks without needing human intervention.
- `Trojans`: Also known as Trojan Horses, these are disguised as genuine software to trick users into running them.
- `Ransomware`: This malicious type of malware encrypts files on the target's system, making them unreachable. Attackers then demand a ransom in return for the decryption key, effectively holding the victim's data to ransom.
