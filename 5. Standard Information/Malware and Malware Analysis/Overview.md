`Malware`, short for malicious software, is a term encompassing various types of software designed to infiltrate, exploit, or damage computer systems, networks, and data.

## Malware Types

- `Viruses`
- `Worms`: Worms are autonomous malware capable of multiplying across networks without needing human intervention.
- `Trojans`: Also known as Trojan Horses, these are disguised as genuine software to trick users into running them.
- `Ransomware`: This malicious type of malware encrypts files on the target's system, making them unreachable. Attackers then demand a ransom in return for the decryption key, effectively holding the victim's data to ransom.
- `Spyware`: This type of malware stealthily gathers sensitive data and user activities without their consent.
- `Adware`: It shows uninvited and invasive advertisements on infected systems, often resulting in a poor user experience.
- `Botnets`: These are networks of compromised devices, often referred to as bots or zombies, controlled by a central command-and-control (C2) server.
- `Rootkits`: These are stealthy forms of malware designed to gain unauthorized access and control over the fundamental components (the "root") of an operating system. They alter system functions to conceal their presence, making them extremely challenging to spot and eliminate.
- `Backdoors/RATs (Remote Access Trojans)`: Backdoors and RATs are crafted to offer unauthorized access and control over compromised systems from remote locations.
- `Droppers`: These are a kind of malware used to transport and install extra malicious payloads onto infected systems. They serve as a conduit for other malware, ensuring the covert installation and execution of more sophisticated threats.
- `Information Stealers`: These are tailored to target and extract sensitive data, like login credentials, personal information, or intellectual property, for harmful purposes.
