The concept is based on four categories that occur for each vulnerability:

1. First, we have a `Source` that performs the specific request to a `Process` where the vulnerability gets triggered. 
2. Each process has a specific set of `Privileges` with which it is executed. 
3. Each process has a task with a specific goal or `Destination` to either compute new data or forward it. 

However, the individual and unique specifications under these categories may differ from service to service.
