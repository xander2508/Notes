The concept is based on four categories that occur for each vulnerability:

1. First, we have a `Source` that performs the specific request to a `Process` where the vulnerability gets triggered. 
2. Each process has a specific set of `Privileges` with which it is executed. 
3. Each process has a task with a specific goal or `Destination` to either compute new data or forward it. 

However, the individual and unique specifications under these categories may differ from service to service.

## Source

We can generalize `Source` as a source of information used for the specific task of a process. There are many different ways to pass information to a process. The graphic shows some of the most common examples of how information is passed to the processes.

| **Information Source** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Code`                 | This means that the already executed program code results are used as a source of information. These can come from different functions of a program.                                               |
| `Libraries`            | A library is a collection of program resources, including configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, prebuilt code and subroutines, classes, values, or type specifications. |
| `Config`               | Configurations are usually static or prescribed values that determine how the process processes information.                                                                                       |
| `APIs`                 | The application programming interface (API) is mainly used as the interface of programs for retrieving or providing information.                                                                   |
| `User Input`           | If a program has a function that allows the user to enter specific values used to process the information accordingly, this is the manual entry of information by a person.                        |
The source is, therefore, the source that is exploited for vulnerabilities.
## Processes

The `Process` is about processing the information forwarded from the source. These are processed according to the intended task determined by the program code. For each task, the developer specifies how the information is processed. This can occur using classes with different functions, calculations, and loops. The variety of possibilities for this is as diverse as the number of developers in the world. Accordingly, most of the vulnerabilities lie in the program code executed by the process.

## Privileges

`Privileges` are present in any system that controls processes. These serve as a type of permission that determines what tasks and actions can be performed on the system. In computer systems, these privileges serve as control and segmentation of actions for which different permissions, controlled by the system, are needed. Therefore, the rights are checked based on this categorization when a process needs to fulfil its task. If the process satisfies these privileges and conditions, the system approves the action requested. We can divide these privileges into the following areas:

| **Privileges** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `System`       | These privileges are the highest privileges that can be obtained, which allow any system modification. In Windows, this type of privilege is called `SYSTEM`, and in Linux, it is called `root`.          |
| `User`         | User privileges are permissions that have been assigned to a specific user. For security reasons, separate users are often set up for particular services during the installation of Linux distributions. |
| `Groups`       | Groups are a categorization of at least one user who has certain permissions to perform specific actions.                                                                                                 |
| `Policies`     | Policies determine the execution of application-specific commands, which can also apply to individual or grouped users and their actions.                                                                 |
| `Rules`        | Rules are the permissions to perform actions handled from within the applications themselves.                                                                                                             |
