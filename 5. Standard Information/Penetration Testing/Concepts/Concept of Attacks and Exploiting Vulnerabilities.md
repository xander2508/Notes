The concept is based on four categories that occur for each vulnerability:

1. First, we have a `Source` that performs the specific request to a `Process` where the vulnerability gets triggered. 
2. Each process has a specific set of `Privileges` with which it is executed. 
3. Each process has a task with a specific goal or `Destination` to either compute new data or forward it. 

However, the individual and unique specifications under these categories may differ from service to service.

## Source

We can generalize `Source` as a source of information used for the specific task of a process. There are many different ways to pass information to a process. The graphic shows some of the most common examples of how information is passed to the processes.

| **Information Source** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `Code`                 | This means that the already executed program code results are used as a source of information. These can come from different functions of a program.                                               |
| `Libraries`            | A library is a collection of program resources, including configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, prebuilt code and subroutines, classes, values, or type specifications. |
| `Config`               | Configurations are usually static or prescribed values that determine how the process processes information.                                                                                       |
| `APIs`                 | The application programming interface (API) is mainly used as the interface of programs for retrieving or providing information.                                                                   |
| `User Input`           | If a program has a function that allows the user to enter specific values used to process the information accordingly, this is the manual entry of information by a person.                        |
The source is, therefore, the source that is exploited for vulnerabilities.
