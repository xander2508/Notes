Lateral movement is one of the essential components for moving through a corporate network. We can use it to overlap with other internal hosts and further escalate our privileges within the current subnet or another part of the network. However, just like `Pillaging`, the `Lateral Movement` stage requires access to at least one of the systems in the corporate network. In the Exploitation stage, the privileges gained do not play a critical role in the first instance since we can also move through the network without administrator rights.

Lateral movement can be described as a technique used to further our access to additional `hosts`, `applications`, and `services` within a network environment. Lateral movement can also help us gain access to specific domain resources we may need to elevate our privileges. Lateral Movement often enables privilege escalation across hosts. In addition to the explanation we have provided for this concept, we can also study how other respected organizations explain Lateral Movement. Check out these two explanations when time permits:

There are three paths we can take from this stage:

| **Path**                            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Vulnerability Assessment`          | If the penetration test is not finished yet, we can jump from here to the `Vulnerability Assessment` stage. Here, the information already obtained from pillaging is used and analyzed to assess where the network services or applications using an authentication mechanism that we may be able to exploit are running. |
| `Information Gathering / Pillaging` | After a successful lateral movement, we can jump into `Pillaging` once again. This is local information gathering on the target system that we accessed.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Proof-of-Concept`                  | Once we have made the last possible lateral movement and completed our attack on the corporate network, we can summarize the information and steps we have collected and perhaps even automate certain sections that demonstrate vulnerability to the vulnerabilities we have found.                                      |

In this stage, we want to test how far we can move manually in the entire network and what vulnerabilities we can find from the internal perspective that might be exploited. In doing so, we will again run through several phases:

1. [[Pivoting]]
2. [[Evasive Testing]]
3. [[2. Information Gathering|Information Gathering]]
4. [[3. Vulnerability Assessment|Vulnerability Assessment]]
5. (Privilege) Exploitation
6. Post-Exploitation


#### Example

One practical example of `Lateral Movement` would be:

During an assessment, we gained initial access to the target environment and were able to gain control of the local administrator account. We performed a network scan and found three more Windows hosts in the network. We attempted to use the same local administrator credentials, and one of those devices shared the same administrator account. We used the credentials to move laterally to that other device, enabling us to compromise the domain further.
