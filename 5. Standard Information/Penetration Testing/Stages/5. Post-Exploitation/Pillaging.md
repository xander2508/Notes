Pillaging is performed to collect sensitive information locally on the already exploited host, such as employee names, customer data, and much more. However, this information gathering only occurs after exploiting the target host and gaining access to it.

The information we can obtain on the exploited hosts can be divided into many different categories and varies greatly. This depends on the purpose of the host and its positioning in the corporate network. The administrators taking the security measures for these hosts also play a significant role. Nevertheless, such information can show the `impact` of a potential attack on our client and be used for further steps to `escalate our privileges` or `move laterally` further in the network.

Pillaging is the stage where we examine the role of the host in the corporate network. We analyze the network configurations, including but not limited to:

- Interfaces
- Routing
- DNS
- ARP	Services
- VPN
- IP Subnets
- Shares
- Network Traffic
