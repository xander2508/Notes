Once we have an overview of the system, our immediate next step is maintaining access to the exploited host. This way, if the connection is interrupted, we can still access it. This step is essential and often used as the first step before the `Information Gathering` and `Pillaging` stages. 

We should establish persistence to the system as soon as possible to avoid having to attack the service multiple times and potentially causing a disruption. Often if we lose the connection, we will not be able to access the system in the same way.
