During the `Information Gathering` and `Pillaging` stage, we will often be able to find, among other things, considerable personal information and customer data. Some clients will want to check whether it is possible to exfiltrate these types of data. This means we try to transfer this information from the target system to our own. Security systems such as `Data Loss Prevention` (`DLP`) and `Endpoint Detection and Response` (`EDR`) help detect and prevent data exfiltration. In addition to `Network Monitoring`, many companies use encryption on hard drives to prevent external parties from viewing such information. Before exfiltrating any actual data, we should check with the customer and our manager. It can often be enough to create some bogus data (such as fake credit card numbers or social security numbers) and exfiltrate it to our system. That way, the protection mechanisms that look for patterns in data leaving the network will be tested, but we will not be responsible for any live sensitive data on our testing machine.

Companies must adhere to data security regulations depending on the type of data involved. These include, but are not limited to:

| **Type of Information**               | **Security Regulation**                                         |

Some frameworks companies may follow include:
