Privilege escalation is significant, and in most cases, it represents a critical moment that can open many more new doors for us. Getting the highest possible privileges on the system or domain is often crucial. Therefore we want to get the privileges of the `root` (on `Linux-based` systems) or the domain `administrator`/`local administrator`/`SYSTEM` (on `Windows-based` systems) because this will often allow us to move through the entire network without any restrictions.

However, it is essential to remember that the escalation of privileges does not always have to occur locally on the system. We can also obtain stored credentials during the information gathering stage from other users who are members of a higher privileged group. Exploiting these privileges to log in as another user is also part of privilege escalation because we have escalated our privileges (quickly) using the new set of credentials.
