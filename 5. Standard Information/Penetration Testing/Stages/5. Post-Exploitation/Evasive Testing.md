If a skilled administrator monitors the systems, any change or even a single command could trigger an alarm that will give us away. In many cases, we get kicked out of the network, and then threat hunting begins where we are the focus. We may also lose access to a host (that gets quarantined) or a user account (that gets temporarily disabled or the password changed). Perhaps we did not thoroughly test a payload, or we got careless and ran a command such as `net user` or `whoami` that is often monitored by EDR systems and flagged as anomalous activity.

Evasive testing is divided into three different categories:

- Evasive	
- Hybrid Evasive	
- Non-Evasive

This does not mean that we cannot use all three methods. Suppose our client wants to perform an intrusive penetration test to get as much information as possible and the most in-depth testing results. In that case, we will perform `Non-Evasive` Testing, as the security measures around the network may limit and even stop us. However, this can also be combined with `Evasive` testing, using the same commands and methods for non-evasive testing. We can then see if the security measures can identify and respond to the actions performed. In `Hybrid-Evasive` testing, we can test specific components and security measures that have been defined in advance. This is common when the customer only wants to test specific departments or servers to see if they can withstand the attacks.
