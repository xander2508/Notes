If a skilled administrator monitors the systems, any change or even a single command could trigger an alarm that will give us away. In many cases, we get kicked out of the network, and then threat hunting begins where we are the focus. We may also lose access to a host (that gets quarantined) or a user account (that gets temporarily disabled or the password changed). Perhaps we did not thoroughly test a payload, or we got careless and ran a command such as `net user` or `whoami` that is often monitored by EDR systems and flagged as anomalous activity.
