Sometimes we will run into a situation where we can't find high-quality, known working PoC exploit code. Therefore, it may be necessary to reconstruct the exploit locally on a VM representing our target host to figure out precisely what needs to be adapted and changed. Once we have set up the system locally and installed known components to mirror the target environment as closely as possible (i.e., same version numbers for target services/applications), we can start preparing the exploit by following the steps described in the exploit. Then we test this on a locally hosted VM to ensure it works and does not damage significantly. In other situations, we will encounter misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that we see very often and know exactly which tool or exploit to use and whether the exploit or technique is "safe" or can cause instability.

If ever in doubt before running an attack, it's always best to check with our client, providing them all necessary data so they can make an informed decision on whether they would like us to attempt exploitation or just mark the finding as an issue. If they opt for us not to proceed with exploitation, we can note in the report that it was not confirmed actively but is likely an issue that needs to be addressed. We have a certain amount of leeway during penetration tests and should always use our best judgment if a particular attack seems too risky or could potentially cause a disruption. When in doubt, communicate. Your team lead/manager, the client, will almost certainly prefer extra communication than run into a situation where they are trying to bring a system back online after a failed exploit attempt.
