During the `Exploitation` stage, we look for ways that these weaknesses can be adapted to our use case to obtain the desired role (i.e., a foothold, escalated privileges, etc.). If we want to get a reverse shell, we need to modify the PoC to execute the code, so the target system connects back to us over (ideally) an encrypted connection to an IP address we specify. Therefore, the preparation of an exploit is mainly part of the `Exploitation` stage.

| `Information Gathering` | Once we have initial access to the target system, regardless of how high our privileges are at that moment, we need to gather information about the local system. Whether we use this new information for privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration does not matter. Therefore, before we can take any further steps, we need to find out what we are dealing with. This inevitably takes us to the vulnerability assessment stage, where we analyze and evaluate the information we find.                                                                                                                              |
| `Post-Exploitation`     | `Post-exploitation` is mainly about escalating privileges if we have not yet attained the highest possible rights on the target host. As we know, more opportunities are open to us with higher privileges. This path actually includes the stages `Information Gathering`, `Vulnerability Assessment`, `Exploitation`, and `Lateral Movement` but from an internal perspective on the target system. The direct jump to post-exploitation is less frequent, but it does happen. Because through the exploitation stage, we may already have obtained the highest privileges, and from here on, we start again at `Information Gathering`. |
| `Lateral Movement`      | From here, we can also skip directly over to `Lateral Movement`. This can come under different conditions. If we have achieved the highest privileges on a dual-homed system used to connect two networks, we can likely use this host to start enumerating hosts that were not previously available to us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `Proof-of-Concept`      | We can take the last path after gaining the highest privileges by exploiting an internal system. Of course, we do not necessarily have to have taken over all systems. However, if we have gained the Domain Admin privileges in an Active Directory environment, we can likely move freely across the entire network and perform any actions we can imagine. So we can create the `Proof-of-Concept` from our notes to detail and potentially automate the paths and activities and make them available to the technical department.                                                                                                      |
