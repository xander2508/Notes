`Information Gathering` and `Vulnerability Research` can be considered a part of descriptive analysis. This is where we identify the individual network or system components we are investigating. In `Vulnerability Research`, we look for known vulnerabilities, exploits, and security holes that have already been discovered and reported. Therefore, if we have identified a version of a service or application through information gathering and found a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/FAQs), it is very likely that this vulnerability is still present.

We can find vulnerability disclosures for each component using many different sources. These include, but are not limited to:

| [CVEdetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/)                 | [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)               | [Vulners](https://vulners.com/) |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| [Packet Storm Security](https://packetstormsecurity.com/) | [NIST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search?execution=e2s1) |                                 |

This is where `Diagnostic Analysis` and `Predictive Analysis` is used. Once we have found a published vulnerability like this, we can diagnose it to determine what is causing or has caused the vulnerability. Here, we must understand the functionality of the `Proof-Of-Concept` (`POC`) code or the application or service itself as best as possible, as many manual configurations by administrators will require some customization for the POC. Each POC is tailored to a specific case that we will also need to adapt to ours in most cases.
