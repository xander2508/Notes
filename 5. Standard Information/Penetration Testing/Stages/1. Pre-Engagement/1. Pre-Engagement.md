The pre-engagement stage is where the main commitments, tasks, scope, limitations, and related agreements are documented in writing. 

During this stage, contractual documents are drawn up, and essential information is exchanged that is relevant for penetration testers and the client, depending on the type of assessment.

The client informs us about what they want to be tested, and we explain in detail how to make the test as efficient as possible.

- `Non-Disclosure Agreement`
- `Goals`
- `Scope`
- `Time Estimation`
- `Rules of Engagement`


The entire pre-engagement process consists of three essential components:
1. [[Scoping Questionnaire]]
2. [[Pre-Engagement Meeting]]
3. [[Kick-Off Meeting]]

It is essential to know `who in the company is permitted` to contract us for a penetration test.
