In service enumeration, we identify services that allow us to interact with the host or server over the network (or locally, from an internal perspective). Therefore, it is crucial to find out about the service, what `version` it is, what `information` it provides us, and the `reason` it can be used. Once we understand the background of what this service has been provisioned for, some logical conclusions can be drawn to provide us with several options.

Many services have a version history that allows us to identify whether the installed version on the host or server is actually up to date or not. This will also help us find security vulnerabilities that remain with older versions in most cases.
