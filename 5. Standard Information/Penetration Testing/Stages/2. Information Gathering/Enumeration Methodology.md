Â This methodology is nested in 6 layers and represents, metaphorically speaking, boundaries that we try to pass with the enumeration process:

These layers are designed as follows:

| **Layer**                | **Description**                                                                                        | **Information Categories**                                                                                                                           |

| `1. Internet Presence`   | Identification of internet presence and externally accessible infrastructure.                          | Domains, Subdomains, vHosts, ASN, Netblocks, IP Addresses, Cloud Instances, Security Measures, [[1. Recon/Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)/1. Guide\|OSINT]] |
| `2. Gateway`             | Identify the possible security measures to protect the company's external and internal infrastructure. | Firewalls, DMZ, IPS/IDS, EDR, Proxies, NAC, Network Segmentation, VPN, Cloudflare                                                                    |
| `3. Accessible Services` | Identify accessible interfaces and services that are hosted externally or internally.                  | Service Type, Functionality, Configuration, Port, Version, Interface                                                                                 |
| `4. Processes`           | Identify the internal processes, sources, and destinations associated with the services.               | PID, Processed Data, Tasks, Source, Destination                                                                                                      |
| `5. Privileges`          | Identification of the internal permissions and privileges to the accessible services.                  | Groups, Users, Permissions, Restrictions, Environment                                                                                                |
| `6. OS Setup`            | Identification of the internal components and systems setup.                                           | OS Type, Patch Level, Network config, OS Environment, Configuration files, sensitive private files                                                   |

## Layer No.1: Internet Presence

In this layer, we use different techniques to find domains, subdomains, netblocks, and many other components and information that present the presence of the company and its infrastructure on the Internet.

`The goal of this layer is to identify all possible target systems and interfaces that can be tested.`

This can be achieved in one way by Googling for the companies websites. Reviewing these websites can provide information on connected services it may use which will be useful in the future.

## Layer No.2: Gateway

Here we try to understand the interface of the reachable target, how it is protected, and where it is located in the network.

`The goal is to understand what we are dealing with and what we have to watch out for.`

## Layer No.3: Accessible Services

In the case of accessible services, we examine each destination for all the services it offers. Each of these services has a specific purpose that has been installed for a particular reason by the administrator. Each service has certain functions, which therefore also lead to specific results. To work effectively with them, we need to know how they work. Otherwise, we need to learn to understand them.

`This layer aims to understand the reason and functionality of the target system and gain the necessary knowledge to communicate with it and exploit it for our purposes effectively.`

## Layer No.4: Processes

Every time a command or function is executed, data is processed, whether entered by the user or generated by the system. This starts a process that has to perform specific tasks, and such tasks have at least one source and one target.

`The goal here is to understand these factors and identify the dependencies between them.`

## Layer No.5: Privileges

Each service runs through a specific user in a particular group with permissions and privileges defined by the administrator or the system. These privileges often provide us with functions that administrators overlook. This often happens in Active Directory infrastructures and many other case-specific administration environments and servers where users are responsible for multiple administration areas.

`It is crucial to identify these and understand what is and is not possible with these privileges.`

## Layer No.6: OS Setup

Here we collect information about the actual operating system and its setup using internal access. This gives us a good overview of the internal security of the systems and reflects the skills and capabilities of the company's administrative teams.

`The goal here is to see how the administrators manage the systems and what sensitive internal information we can glean from them.`
