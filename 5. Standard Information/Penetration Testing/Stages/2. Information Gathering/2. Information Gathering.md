Information gathering is an essential part of any assessment. Because information, the knowledge gained from it, the conclusions we draw, and the steps we take are based on the information available. This information must be obtained from somewhere, so it is critical to know how to retrieve it and best leverage it based on our assessment goals.

The information we gather in advance will influence the results of the `Exploitation` stage. From this, we can see if we have collected enough or dived deep enough. Time, patience, and personal commitment all play a significant role in information gathering. This is when many penetration testers tend to jump straight into exploiting a potential vulnerability. This often fails and can lead, among other things, to a significant loss of time. Before attempting to exploit anything, we should have completed thorough information gathering, keeping detailed notes along the way, focusing on things to hone in on once we get to the exploitation stage. Most assessments are time-based, so we don't want to waste time bouncing around, which could lead to us missing something critical. Organization and patience are vital while being as thorough as possible.

All the steps we take to exploit the vulnerabilities are based on the information we enumerate about our targets. This phase can be considered the cornerstone of any penetration test. We can obtain the necessary information relevant to us in many different ways. However, we can divide them into the following categories:

- Open-Source Intelligence
- Infrastructure Enumeration
- Service Enumeration
- Host Enumeration

All four categories should and must be performed by us for each penetration test. This is because the `information` is the main component that leads us to successful penetration testing and identifying security vulnerabilities.
