In most cases, when we exploit certain services for our purposes to gain access to the system, we usually do not obtain the highest possible privileges. Because services are typically configured in a certain way "isolated" to stop potential attackers, bypassing these restrictions is the next step we take in this stage. However, it is not always easy to escalate the privileges. After gaining in-depth knowledge about how these operating systems function, we must adapt our techniques to the particular operating system and carefully study how `Linux Privilege Escalation` and `Windows Privilege Escalation` work.

From this stage, there are four paths we can take, depending on how far we have come:

| **Path**                            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Information Gathering / Pillaging` | Before we can begin escalating privileges, we must first get an overview of the inner workings of the exploited system. After all, we do not know which users are on the system and what options are available to us up to this point. This step is also known as `Pillaging`. This path is not optional, as with the others, but essential. Again, entering the `Information Gathering` stage puts us in this perspective. This inevitably takes us to the vulnerability assessment stage, where we analyze and evaluate the information we find. |
| `Exploitation`                      | Suppose we have found sensitive information about the system and its' contents. In that case, we can use it to exploit local applications or services with higher privileges to execute commands with those privileges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Lateral Movement`                  | From here, we can also skip directly over to `Lateral Movement`. This can come under different conditions. If we have achieved the highest privileges on a dual-homed system used to connect two networks, we can likely use this host to start enumerating hosts that were not previously available to us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Proof-of-Concept`                  | We can take the last path after gaining the highest privileges by exploiting an internal system. Of course, we do not necessarily have to have taken over all systems. However, if we have gained the Domain Admin privileges in an Active Directory environment, we can likely move freely across the entire network and perform any actions we can imagine. So we can create the `Proof-of-Concept` from our notes to detail and potentially automate the paths and activities and make them available to the technical department.              |

After we have gained access to a system, we must be able to take further steps from within the system. During a penetration test, customers often want to find out how far an attacker could go in their network. There are many different versions of operating systems. For example, we may run into Windows XP, Windows 7, 8, 10, 11, and Windows Server 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2019. There are also different distributions for Linux-based operating systems, such as Ubuntu, Debian, Parrot OS, Arch, Deepin, Redhat, Pop!_OS, and many others. No matter which of these systems we get into, we have to find our way around it and understand the individual weak points that a system can have from within.
