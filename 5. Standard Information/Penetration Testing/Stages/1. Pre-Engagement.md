The pre-engagement stage is where the main commitments, tasks, scope, limitations, and related agreements are documented in writing. 

During this stage, contractual documents are drawn up, and essential information is exchanged that is relevant for penetration testers and the client, depending on the type of assessment.

The client informs us about what they want to be tested, and we explain in detail how to make the test as efficient as possible.

- `Non-Disclosure Agreement`
- `Goals`
- `Scope`
- `Time Estimation`
- `Rules of Engagement`


The entire pre-engagement process consists of three essential components:
1. Scoping questionnaire
2. Pre-engagement meeting
3. Kick-off meeting

It is essential to know `who in the company is permitted` to contract us for a penetration test.

## Scoping Questionnaire 

After initial contact is made with the client, we typically send them a `Scoping Questionnaire` to better understand the services they are seeking. This scoping questionnaire should clearly explain our services and may typically ask them to choose one or more from the following list:

- Internal Vulnerability Assessment 
- Internal Penetration Test         
- Wireless Security Assessment      
- Physical Security Assessment      
- Red Team Assessment               
- External Vulnerability Assessment
- External Penetration Test
- Application Security Assessment
- Social Engineering Assessment
- Web Application Security Assessment

Under each of these, the questionnaire should allow the client to be more specific about the required assessment. Do they need a web application or mobile application assessment? Secure code review? Should the Internal Penetration Test be black box and semi-evasive? Do they want just a phishing assessment as part of the Social Engineering Assessment or also vishing calls? This is our chance to explain the depth and breadth of our services, ensure that we understand our client's needs and expectations, and ensure that we can adequately deliver the assessment they require.

Aside from the assessment type, client name, address, and key personnel contact information, some other critical pieces of information include:

- How many expected live hosts?	
- How many IPs/CIDR ranges in scope?	
- How many Domains/Subdomains are in scope?	
- How many wireless SSIDs in scope?	
- How many web/mobile applications? If testing is authenticated, how many roles (standard user, admin, etc.)?	
- For a phishing assessment, how many users will be targeted? Will the client provide a list, or we will be required to gather this list via OSINT?	
- If the client is requesting a Physical Assessment, how many locations? If multiple sites are in-scope, are they geographically dispersed?	
- What is the objective of the Red Team Assessment? Are any activities (such as phishing or physical security attacks) out of scope?	
- Is a separate Active Directory Security Assessment desired?	
- Will network testing be conducted from an anonymous user on the network or a standard domain user?	
- Do we need to bypass Network Access Control (NAC)?

Finally, we will want to ask about information disclosure and evasiveness (if applicable to the assessment type):

- Is the Penetration Test black box (no information provided), grey box (only IP address/CIDR ranges/URLs provided), white box (detailed information provided)
- Would they like us to test from a non-evasive, hybrid-evasive (start quiet and gradually become "louder" to assess at what level the client's security personnel detect our activities), or fully evasive.

This information will help us ensure we assign the right resources and deliver the engagement based on the client's expectations. This information is also necessary for providing an accurate proposal with a project timeline (for example, a Vulnerability Assessment will take considerably less time than a Red Team Assessment) and cost (an External Penetration Test against 10 IPs will cost significantly less than an Internal Penetration Test with 30 /24 networks in-scope).

Based on the information we received from the scoping questionnaire, we create an overview and summarize all information in the `Scoping Document`.

## Pre-Engagement Meeting

Once we have an initial idea of the client's project requirements, we can move on to the `pre-engagement meeting`. This meeting discusses all relevant and essential components with the customer before the penetration test, explaining them to our customer. The information we gather during this phase, along with the data collected from the scoping questionnaire, will serve as inputs to the `Penetration Testing Proposal`, also known as the `Contract` or `Scope of Work` (`SoW`). We can think of the whole process as a visit to the doctor to inform ourselves regarding the planned examinations. This phase typically occurs via e-mail and during an online conference call or in-person meeting.
