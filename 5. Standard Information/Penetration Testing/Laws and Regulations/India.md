It also criminalizes hacking and other unauthorized access to computer systems and imposes penalties for such actions.

The [Personal Data Protection Bill 2019](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2889) is a proposed legislation to protect individuals' personal data and impose penalties for non-compliance.
