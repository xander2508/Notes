#### PTES

The [Penetration Testing Execution Standard](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page) (`PTES`) can be applied to all types of penetration tests. It outlines the phases of a penetration test and how they should be conducted. These are the sections in the PTES:

- Pre-engagement Interactions
- Intelligence Gathering
- Threat Modelling
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Exploitation
- Post Exploitation
- Reporting

#### OSSTMM

`OSSTMM` is the `Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual`, another set of guidelines pen testers can use to ensure they're doing their jobs properly. It can be used alongside other pen test standards.

[OSSTMM](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf) is divided into five different channels for five different areas of pentesting:

1. Human Security (human beings are subject to social engineering exploits)
2. Physical Security
3. Wireless Communications (including but not limited to technologies like WiFi and Bluetooth)
4. Telecommunications
5. Data Networks

#### NIST

The `NIST` (`National Institute of Standards and Technology`) is well known for their [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), a system for designing incident response policies and procedures. NIST also has a Penetration Testing Framework. The phases of the NIST framework include:

- Planning
- Discovery
- Attack
- Reporting

#### OWASP

`OWASP` stands for the [Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/). They're typically the go-to organization for defining testing standards and classifying risks to web applications.

OWASP maintains a few different standards and helpful guides for assessment various technologies:

- [Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)
- [Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-security-testing-guide/)
- [Firmware Security Testing Methodology](https://github.com/scriptingxss/owasp-fstm)
