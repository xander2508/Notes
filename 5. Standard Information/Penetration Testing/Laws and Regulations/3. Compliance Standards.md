Each regulatory compliance body has its own information security standards that organizations must adhere to maintain their accreditation. The big compliance players in information security are `PCI`, `HIPAA`, `FISMA`, and `ISO 27001`.

These accreditations are necessary because it certifies that an organization has had a third-party vendor evaluate its environment. Organizations also rely on these accreditations for business operations since some companies won't do business without specific accreditations from organizations.

#### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

The [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/) is a commonly known standard in information security that implements requirements for organizations that handle credit cards. While not a government regulation, organizations that store, process, or transmit cardholder data must still implement PCI DSS guidelines. This would include banks or online stores that handle their own payment solutions (e.g., Amazon).

PCI DSS requirements include internal and external scanning of assets. For example, any credit card data that is being processed or transmitted must be done in a Cardholder Data Environment (CDE). The CDE environment must be adequately segmented from normal assets. CDE environments are segmented off from an organization's regular environment to protect any cardholder data from being compromised during an attack and limit internal access to data.

#### Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

`HIPAA` is the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act](https://www.hhs.gov/programs/hipaa/index.html), which is used to protect patients' data. HIPAA does not necessarily require vulnerability scans or assessments; however, a risk assessment and vulnerability identification are required to maintain HIPAA accreditation.

### Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)

The [Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)](https://www.cisa.gov/federal-information-security-modernization-act) is a set of standards and guidelines used to safeguard government operations and information. The act requires an organization to provide documentation and proof of a vulnerability management program to maintain information technology systems' proper availability, confidentiality, and integrity.

#### ISO 27001

`ISO 27001` is a standard used worldwide to manage information security. [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html) requires organizations to perform quarterly external and internal scans.

Although compliance is essential, it should not drive a vulnerability management program. Vulnerability management should consider the uniqueness of an environment and the associated risk appetite to an organization.

The `International Organization for Standardization` (`ISO`) maintains technical standards for pretty much anything you can imagine. The [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html) standard deals with information security. ISO 27001 compliance depends upon maintaining an effective Information Security Management System. To ensure compliance, organizations must perform penetration tests in a carefully designed way.
