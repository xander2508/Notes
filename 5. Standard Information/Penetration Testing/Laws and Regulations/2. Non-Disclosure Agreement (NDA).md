There are several types of NDAs:

| **Type**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `Unilateral NDA`   | This type of NDA obligates only one party to maintain confidentiality and allows the other party to share the information received with third parties.                                                  |
| `Bilateral NDA`    | In this type, both parties are obligated to keep the resulting and acquired information confidential. This is the most common type of NDA that protects the work of penetration testers.                |
| `Multilateral NDA` | Multilateral NDA is a commitment to confidentiality by more than two parties. If we conduct a penetration test for a cooperative network, all parties responsible and involved must sign this document. |
