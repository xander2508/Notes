Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) refers to a secrecy contract between the client and the contractor regarding all written or verbal information concerning an order/project. The contractor agrees to treat all confidential information brought to its attention as strictly confidential, even after the order/project is completed. Furthermore, any exceptions to confidentiality, the transferability of rights and obligations, and contractual penalties shall be stipulated in the agreement. The NDA should be signed before the kick-off meeting or at the latest during the meeting before any information is discussed in detail.

There are several types of NDAs:

| **Type**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `Unilateral NDA`   | This type of NDA obligates only one party to maintain confidentiality and allows the other party to share the information received with third parties.                                                  |
| `Bilateral NDA`    | In this type, both parties are obligated to keep the resulting and acquired information confidential. This is the most common type of NDA that protects the work of penetration testers.                |
| `Multilateral NDA` | Multilateral NDA is a commitment to confidentiality by more than two parties. If we conduct a penetration test for a cooperative network, all parties responsible and involved must sign this document. |
