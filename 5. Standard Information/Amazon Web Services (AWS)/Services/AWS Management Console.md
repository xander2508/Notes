[What Is the AWS Management Console?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/)

One way to manage cloud resources is through the web-based console, where you log in and choose the desired service. 

This can be the easiest way to create and manage resources when you first begin working with the cloud. The following is a screenshot that shows the landing page when you first log in to the console.

In the upper-left corner, you can choose **Services** to view AWS services grouped by categories, such as Compute, Storage, Database, and Analytics.  
  
In the upper-right corner is the [[Regions]] selector. If you choose it and change the Region, you will make requests to the services in the chosen Region. The URL changes, too. Changing the Region setting directs your browser to make requests to a different AWS Region, represented by a different subdomain.
