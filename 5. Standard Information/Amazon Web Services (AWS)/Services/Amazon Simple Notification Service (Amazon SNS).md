**Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)**Â is a publish/subscribe service. Using Amazon SNS topics, a publisher publishes messages to subscribers. This is similar to the coffee shop; the cashier provides coffee orders to the barista who makes the drinks.

In Amazon SNS, subscribers can be web servers, email addresses, AWS Lambda functions, or several other options

Subscribers will now receive updates immediately for only the specific topics to which they have subscribed.
It is possible for subscribers to subscribe to a single topic or to multiple topics.
