AWS Health is the authoritative data source for events and changes affecting your AWS cloud resources. 
AWS Health notifies you about service events, planned changes, and account notifications to help you manage and take actions. Sign into your AWS Health Dashboard to view account-specific health information or receive AWS Health event updates using Amazon EventBridge. You can also access AWS Health programmatically using AWS Health API, available with AWS Premium Support.
