[**AWS WAF**](https://aws.amazon.com/waf) is a web application firewall that lets you monitor network requests that come into your web applications. 

AWS WAF works together with Amazon CloudFront and an Application Load Balancer.

When a request comes into AWS WAF, it checks against the list of rules that you have configured in the web ACL. If a request does not come from one of the blocked IP addresses, it allows access to the application.
