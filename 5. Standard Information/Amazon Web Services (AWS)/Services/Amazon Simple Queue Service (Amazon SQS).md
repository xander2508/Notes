Using Amazon SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available. In Amazon SQS, an application sends messages into a queue. A user or service retrieves a message from the queue, processes it, and then deletes it from the queue.

For decoupled applications and microservices, Amazon SQS enables you to send, store, and retrieve messages between components.Â 

This decoupled approach enables the separate components to work more efficiently and independently.
