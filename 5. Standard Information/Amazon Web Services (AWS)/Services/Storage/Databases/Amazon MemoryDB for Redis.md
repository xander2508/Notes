MemoryDB is a Redis-compatible, durable, in-memory database service that delivers ultra-fast performance. 

With MemoryDB, you can achieve microsecond read latency, single-digit millisecond write latency, high throughput, and Multi-AZ durability for modern applications, like those built with microservices architectures. 

You can use MemoryDB as a fully managed, primary database to build high-performance applications. You do not need to separately manage a cache, durable database, or the required underlying infrastructure.
