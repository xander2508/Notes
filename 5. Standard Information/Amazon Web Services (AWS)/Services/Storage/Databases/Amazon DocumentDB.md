Amazon DocumentDB is a fully managed document database from AWS. 

A document database is a type of NoSQL database you can use to store and query rich documents in your application. These types of databases work well for the following use cases: content management systems, profile management, and web and mobile applications. Amazon DocumentDB has API compatibility with MongoDB. 

This means you can use popular open-source libraries to interact with Amazon DocumentDB, or you can migrate existing databases to Amazon DocumentDB with minimal hassle.
