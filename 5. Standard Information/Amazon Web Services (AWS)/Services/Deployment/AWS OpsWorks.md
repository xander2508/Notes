AWS OpsWorks is an application-management service that makes it easy for both developers and operations personnel to deploy and operate applications of all shapes and sizes. AWS OpsWorks works best if you want to deploy your code, have some abstraction from the underlying infrastructure, and have an application more complex than a three-tier architecture. AWS OpsWorks is also recommended if you want to manage your infrastructure with a configuration management system such as Chef.
