Amazon Connect empowers contact centre agents to deliver superior customer experiences from day one. With Amazon Q, a generative AI-powered assistant available in Amazon Connect, customer issues are automatically detected, and agents are provided contextual customer information and suggested responses and actions for faster resolution, all within the unified workspace. In addition, you can guide your agents to resolve customer issues quickly and accurately by automatically recommending appropriate actions to take with step-by-step guides.
