AWS CAF organises guidance into six areas of focus called perspectives. AWS CAF helps to uncover existing gaps an organization might have and gets it to a stage of readiness.

Each perspective is used to create work streams that uncover gaps in existing skills and processes which are recorded as inputs.

AWS CAF assists in visualizing the future state of your customer’s organization. It can help identify and strategically address any readiness gaps to ensure your customer’s business is well-prepared for cloud migration

In general, the **Business**, **People**, and **Governance** Perspectives focus on business capabilities, whereas the **Platform**, **Security**, and **Operations** Perspectives focus on technical capabilities.

### Business Perspective

What to implement

The **Business Perspective** ensures that IT aligns with business needs and that IT investments link to key business results.

Use the Business Perspective to create a strong business case for cloud adoption and prioritize cloud adoption initiatives. Ensure that your business strategies and goals align with your IT strategies and goals.

### People Perspective

What to train

The **People Perspective** supports development of an organization-wide change management strategy for successful cloud adoption.

Use the People Perspective to evaluate organizational structures and roles, new skill and process requirements, and identify gaps. This helps prioritize training, staffing, and organizational changes.
### Governance Perspective

How to train

The **Governance Perspective** focuses on the skills and processes to align IT strategy with business strategy. This ensures that you maximize the business value and minimize risks.

Use the Governance Perspective to understand how to update the staff skills and processes necessary to ensure business governance in the cloud. Manage and measure cloud investments to evaluate business outcomes.
### Platform Perspective

How to implement 

The **Platform Perspective** includes principles and patterns for implementing new solutions on the cloud, and migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud.

Use a variety of architectural models to understand and communicate the structure of IT systems and their relationships. Describe the architecture of the target state environment in detail.
### Security Perspective

How to secure

The **Security Perspective** ensures that the organization meets security objectives for visibility, auditability, control, and agility. 

Use the AWS CAF to structure the selection and implementation of security controls that meet the organization’s needs.
### Operations Perspective

How to operate 

The **Operations Perspective** helps you to enable, run, use, operate, and recover IT workloads to the level agreed upon with your business stakeholders.

Define how day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, and year-to-year business is conducted. Align with and support the operations of the business. The AWS CAF helps these stakeholders define current operating procedures and identify the process changes and training needed to implement successful cloud adoption.
## Stages 

- Envision
	- Connect your business goals and outcomes to enabling technologies, identifying key measures, and helping you prioritize your cloud initiatives.
	- List goals and hopes 
- Alignment
	- Create a usable action plan that helps you determine what cloud adoption means to your customer’s organization. It surfaces key benefits for stakeholders, establishes the best approach, and drives clarity to guide the organization's change management during their cloud journey
	- Create a plan
- Launch
	- Launch workstreams for production cloud deployment, completing your cloud projects, proactively addressing stakeholder's concerns, and starting to use the cloud for incremental business value.
	- Run the plan
- Scale
	- Measure success and iterate to deliver against your organization’s business plans. Expand production pilots to ensure that the business benefits associated with your organization’s cloud investments are realized and sustained.
	- Measure success and repeat

AWS provides seven common approaches, which include: refactor, replatform, repurchase, rehost, relocate, retain, and retire. Because each application is unique, enterprises often use multiple strategies for separate applications.

#### Relocate

Relocate means to move applications or workloads to the cloud with minimal downtime and without any change to your existing operations or technical stack.

A common use case for this migration scenario is to quickly relocated to AWS using the infrastructure that’s most familiar to your customer. A relocate strategy would be the fastest method to use in this type of scenario.
#### Rehost

"lift and shift"

In this approach, applications or workloads are migrated to AWS without any changes to the underlying operating system or application stack. Customers can use lift and shift strategy to quickly migrate, and then focus on application modernization. After the application is in the cloud, it will be more convenient to get to a cloud optimized state.

#### Replatform

"lift, tinker, and shift"

In practice, this could look like modernizing the database layer of your customer’s application to a managed service. Which means spending less time on day-to-day operations and more time focused on your business logic.

#### Repurchase

This means replacing your existing application with a different version or product. This approach makes sense when you are looking for a strategy that provides more business value than the existing, on-premises application. Such benefits include accessibility from anywhere, no infrastructure maintenance, and pay-as-you-go pricing models. Repurchasing the application typically reduces costs associated with maintenance, infrastructure, and licensing.

#### Refactor

This means re-designing application architecture or rewriting an application before the migration to make it a cloud-native application. Overall, it’s taking monolithic applications and breaking them down to modular architecture, which is beneficial for adding new features, improving performance, and scaling to meet your customers’ current resources.

#### Retire

This is useful if your customers discover that an application is no longer necessary and can be decommissioned. After doing an audit of on-premises applications, you may be surprised with how many applications are up and running but simply are no longer needed or not being used!
#### Retain

Your customers can retain the application for now, or revisit at a later date. This strategy is useful if some applications can’t be immediately migrated due to licensing or other reasons. Retain could also be the appropriate strategy if your customer recently invested in upgrading their current system and you want to postpone migrating the application until the next refresh.
