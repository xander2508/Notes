## AWS Pricing Calculator
  
The [**AWS Pricing Calculator**](https://calculator.aws/#/) lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS. You can organize your AWS estimates by groups that you define. A group can reflect how your company is organized, such as providing estimates by cost centre.

When you have created an estimate, you can save it and generate a link to share it with others.
