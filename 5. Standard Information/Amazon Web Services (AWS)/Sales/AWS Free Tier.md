The [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) enables you to begin using certain services without having to worry about incurring costs for the specified period. 

Three types of offers are available: 

- Always Free
- 12 Months Free
- Trials

#### Always Free

These offers do not expire and are available to all AWS customers.

#### 12 Months Free

These offers are free for 12 months following your initial sign-up date to AWS.

#### Trials

Short-term free trial offers start from the date you activate a particular service. The length of each trial might vary by number of days or the amount of usage in the service.

For example, Amazon Inspector offers a 90-day free trial. Amazon Lightsail (a service that enables you to run virtual private servers) offers 750 free hours of usage over a 30-day period.
