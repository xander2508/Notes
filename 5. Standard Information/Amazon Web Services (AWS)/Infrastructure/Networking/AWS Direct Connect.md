[What Is AWS Direct Connect(opens in a new tab)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)?


To establish a secure physical connection between your on-premises data center and your Amazon VPC, you can use AWS Direct Connect.

This connection allows you to create virtual interfaces directly to public AWS services or to your VPC.![[Pasted image 20240729154512.png]]
