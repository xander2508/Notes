An Availability Zone consists of one or more data centres with redundant power, networking, and connectivity. These data centres operate in discrete facilities in undisclosed locations. They are connected using redundant high-speed and low-latency links.

Availability Zones also have code names. Because they are located inside [[Regions]], they can be addressed by appending a letter to the end of the Region code name. Here are examples of Availability Zone codes:

- **us-east-1a** is an Availability Zone in us-east-1 (N. Virginia Region).
- **sa-east-1b** is an Availability Zone in sa-east-1 (São Paulo Region).

Therefore, if you see that a resource exists in us-east-1c, you can infer that the resource is located in Availability Zone c of the us-east-1 Region.
