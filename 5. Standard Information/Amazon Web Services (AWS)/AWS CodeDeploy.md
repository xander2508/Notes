AWS CodeDeploy is a service that coordinates application deployments across Amazon EC2 instances.18 AWS CodeDeploy works with your existing application files and deployment scripts, and it can easily reuse existing configuration management scripts. The service scales with your infrastructure so you can deploy to as few as one EC2 instance or thousands. 

AWS CodeDeploy is a good choice if you want to deploy code to infrastructure managed by yourself or other people in your organization. Use AWS CodeDeploy to deploy code to infrastructure that is provisioned and managed with AWS CloudFormation. Even if you donâ€™t use AWS CloudFormation but you use Amazon EC2 with third-party integration, AWS CodeDeploy can help manage your application deployment.
