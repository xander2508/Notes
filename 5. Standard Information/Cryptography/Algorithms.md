| `Diffie-Hellman`                             | `DH`        | Relatively secure and computationally efficient                            |
| `Rivest–Shamir–Adleman`                      | `RSA`       | Widely used and considered secure, but computationally intensive           |
| `Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman`              | `ECDH`      | Provides enhanced security compared to traditional Diffie-Hellman          |
| `Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm` | `ECDSA`     | Provides enhanced security and efficiency for digital signature generation |
