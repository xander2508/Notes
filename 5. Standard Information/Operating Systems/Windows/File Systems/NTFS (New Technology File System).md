NTFS (New Technology File System) is the default Windows file system since Windows NT 3.1. In addition to making up for the shortcomings of FAT32, NTFS also has better support for metadata and better performance due to improved data structuring.

Pros of NTFS:
- NTFS is reliable and can restore the consistency of the file system in the event of a system failure or power loss.
- Provides security by allowing us to set granular permissions on both files and folders.
- Supports very large-sized partitions.
- Has journaling built-in, meaning that file modifications (addition, modification, deletion) are logged.

Cons of NTFS:
- Most mobile devices do not support NTFS natively.
- Older media devices such as TVs and digital cameras do not offer support for NTFS storage devices.
