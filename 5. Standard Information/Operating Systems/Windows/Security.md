## Security Identifier (SID)

Each of the security principals on the system has a unique security identifier (SID). The system automatically generates SIDs. This means that even if, for example, we have two identical users on the system, Windows can distinguish the two and their rights based on their SIDs. SIDs are string values with different lengths, which are stored in the security database. These SIDs are added to the user's access token to identify all actions that the user is authorized to take.

A SID consists of the Identifier Authority and the Relative ID (RID). In an Active Directory (AD) domain environment, the SID also includes the domain SID.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> whoami /user

USER INFORMATION

User Name           SID

ws01\bob S-1-5-21-674899381-4069889467-2080702030-1002
```

The SID is broken down into this pattern.

```powershell-session
(SID)-(revision level)-(identifier-authority)-(subauthority1)-(subauthority2)-(etc)
```

Let's break down the SID piece by piece.

|**Number**|**Meaning**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|S|SID|Identifies the string as a SID.|
|1|Revision Level|To date, this has never changed and has always beenÂ `1`.|
|5|Identifier-authority|A 48-bit string that identifies the authority (the computer or network) that created the SID.|
|21|Subauthority1|This is a variable number that identifies the user's relation or group described by the SID to the authority that created it. It tells us in what order this authority created the user's account.|
|674899381-4069889467-2080702030|Subauthority2|Tells us which computer (or domain) created the number|
|1002|Subauthority3|The RID that distinguishes one account from another. Tells us whether this user is a normal user, a guest, an administrator, or part of some other group|
