When a user or a system tries to perform a Name Resolution (NR), a series of procedures are conducted by a machine to retrieve a host's IP address by its hostname. On Windows machines, the procedure will roughly be as follows:

- The hostname file share's IP address is required.
- The local host file (C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts) will be checked for suitable records.
- If no records are found, the machine switches to the local DNS cache, which keeps track of recently resolved names.
- Is there no local DNS record? A query will be sent to the DNS server that has been configured.
- If all else fails, the machine will issue a multicast query, requesting the IP address of the file share from other machines on the network.

Suppose a user mistyped a shared folder's name `\\mysharefoder\` instead of `\\mysharedfolder\`. In that case, all name resolutions will fail because the name does not exist, and the machine will send a multicast query to all devices on the network.
