`lsass.exe` is the process that is responsible for enforcing the security policy on Windows systems. When a user attempts to log on to the system, this process verifies their log on attempt and creates access tokens based on the user's permission levels. LSASS is also responsible for user account password changes. All events associated with this process (logon/logoff attempts, etc.) are logged within the Windows Security Log. LSASS is an extremely high-value target as several tools exist to extract both cleartext and hashed credentials stored in memory by this process.

[Local Security Authority Subsystem Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Security_Authority_Subsystem_Service) (`LSASS`) is a collection of many modules and has access to all authentication processes that can be found in `%SystemRoot%\System32\Lsass.exe`. This service is responsible for the local system security policy, user authentication, and sending security audit logs to the `Event log`. In other words, it is the vault for Windows-based operating systems, and we can find a more detailed illustration of the LSASS architecture [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc961760(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN).

|**Authentication Packages**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Lsasrv.dll`|The LSA Server service both enforces security policies and acts as the security package manager for the LSA. The LSA contains the Negotiate function, which selects either the NTLM or Kerberos protocol after determining which protocol is to be successful.|
|`Msv1_0.dll`|Authentication package for local machine logons that don't require custom authentication.|
|`Samsrv.dll`|The Security Accounts Manager (SAM) stores local security accounts, enforces locally stored policies, and supports APIs.|
|`Kerberos.dll`|Security package loaded by the LSA for Kerberos-based authentication on a machine.|
|`Netlogon.dll`|Network-based logon service.|
|`Ntdsa.dll`|This library is used to create new records and folders in the Windows registry.|

Each interactive logon session creates a separate instance of the Winlogon service. The [Graphical Identification and Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/gina) (`GINA`) architecture is loaded into the process area used by Winlogon, receives and processes the credentials, and invokes the authentication interfaces via the [LSALogonUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ntsecapi/nf-ntsecapi-lsalogonuser) function.
