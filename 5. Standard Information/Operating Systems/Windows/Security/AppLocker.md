[AppLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-overview) is Microsoft's application whitelisting solution and was first introduced in Windows 7. AppLocker gives system administrators control over which applications and files users can run. It gives granular control over executables, scripts, Windows installer files, DLLs, packaged apps, and packed app installers.

It allows for creating rules based on file attributes such as the publisher's name (which can be derived from the digital signature), product name, file name, and version. Rules can also be set up based on file paths and hashes. Rules can be applied to either security groups or individual users, based on the business need. AppLocker can be deployed in audit mode first to test the impact before enforcing all of the rules.
