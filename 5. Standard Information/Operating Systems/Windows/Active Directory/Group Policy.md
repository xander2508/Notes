Group Policy is a Windows feature that provides administrators with a wide array of advanced settings that can apply to both user and computer accounts in a Windows environment.

Every Windows host has a Local Group Policy editor to manage local settings. For our purposes, we will focus on Group Policy in a domain context for managing users and computers in Active Directory. Group Policy is a powerful tool for managing and configuring user settings, operating systems, and applications. Group Policy is also a potent tool for managing security in a domain environment. From a security context, leveraging Group Policy is one of the best ways to widely affect your enterprise's security posture.

## Group Policy Objects (GPOs)

A [Group Policy Object (GPO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/policy/group-policy-objects) is a virtual collection of policy settings that can be applied to `user(s)` or `computer(s)`. GPOs include policies such as screen lock timeout, disabling USB ports, enforcing a custom domain password policy, installing software, managing applications, customizing remote access settings, and much more. Every GPO has a unique name and is assigned a unique identifier (a GUID). They can be linked to a specific OU, domain, or site. A single GPO can be linked to multiple containers, and any container can have multiple GPOs applied to it. They can be applied to individual users, hosts, or groups by being applied directly to an OU. Every GPO contains one or more Group Policy settings that may apply at the local machine level or within the Active Directory context.

#### Order of Precedence

GPO settings are processed using the hierarchical structure of AD and are applied using the `Order of Precedence` rule as seen in the table below:

| **Level**                                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Local Group Policy`                       | The policies are defined directly to the host locally outside the domain. Any setting here will be overwritten if a similar setting is defined at a higher level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `Site Policy`                              | Any policies specific to the Enterprise Site that the host resides in. Remember that enterprise environments can span large campuses and even across countries. So it stands to reason that a site might have its own policies to follow that could differentiate it from the rest of the organization. Access Control policies are a great example of this. Say a specific building or `site` performs secret or restricted research and requires a higher level of authentication for access to resources. You could specify those settings at the site level and ensure they are linked so as not to be overwritten by domain policy. This is also a great way to perform actions like printer and share mapping for users in specific sites. |
| `Domain-wide Policy`                       | Any settings you wish to have applied across the domain as a whole. For example, setting the password policy complexity level, configuring a Desktop background for all users, and setting a Notice of Use and Consent to Monitor banner at the login screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Organizational Unit` (OU)                 | These settings would affect users and computers who belong to specific OUs. You would want to place any unique settings here that are role-specific. For example, the mapping of a particular share drive that can only be accessed by HR, access to specific resources like printers, or the ability for IT admins to utilize PowerShell and command-prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Any OU Policies nested within other OU's` | Settings at this level would reflect special permissions for objects within nested OUs. For example, providing Security Analysts a specific set of Applocker policy settings that differ from the standard IT Applocker settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

We can manage Group Policy from the Group Policy Management Console (found under Administrative Tools in the Start Menu on a domain controller), custom applications, or using the PowerShell [GroupPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/grouppolicy/?view=windowsserver2022-ps) module via command line. The Default Domain Policy is the default GPO that is automatically created and linked to the domain. It has the highest precedence of all GPOs and is applied by default to all users and computers. Generally, it is best practice to use this default GPO to manage default settings that will apply domain-wide. The Default Domain Controllers policy is also created automatically with a domain and sets baseline security and auditing settings for all domain controllers in a given domain. It can be customized as needed, like any GPO.
#### Enforced GPO Policy Precedence

It is possible to specify the `Enforced` option to enforce settings in a specific GPO. If this option is set, policy settings in GPOs linked to lower OUs `CANNOT` override the settings. If a GPO is set at the domain level with the `Enforced` option selected, the settings contained in that GPO will be applied to all OUs in the domain and cannot be overridden by lower-level OU policies.

#### Default Domain Policy Override

It is also possible to set the `Block inheritance` option on an OU. If this is specified for a particular OU, then policies higher up (such as at the domain level) will NOT be applied to this OU. If both options are set, the `No Override` option has precedence over the `Block inheritance` option.
