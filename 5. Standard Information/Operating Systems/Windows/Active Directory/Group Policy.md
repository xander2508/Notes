Group Policy is a Windows feature that provides administrators with a wide array of advanced settings that can apply to both user and computer accounts in a Windows environment.

Every Windows host has a Local Group Policy editor to manage local settings. For our purposes, we will focus on Group Policy in a domain context for managing users and computers in Active Directory. Group Policy is a powerful tool for managing and configuring user settings, operating systems, and applications. Group Policy is also a potent tool for managing security in a domain environment. From a security context, leveraging Group Policy is one of the best ways to widely affect your enterprise's security posture.
