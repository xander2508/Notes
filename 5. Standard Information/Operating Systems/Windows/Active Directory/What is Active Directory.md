TLDR: 
In a nutshell, `Active Directory` (AD) is a directory service for Windows environments that provides a central point of management for `users`, computers, `groups`, network devices, `file shares`, group policies, `devices`, and trusts with other organizations. Think of it as the gatekeeper for an enterprise environment. Anyone who is a part of the domain can access resources freely, while anyone who is not is denied access to those same resources or, at a minimum, stuck waiting in the visitors centre.
