Active Directory is built around the premise of central management and the ability to share information quickly, at will, to a large userbase. Active Directory can be considered insecure by design because of this. A default Active Directory installation will be missing many hardening measures, settings, and tools that can be used to secure an AD implementation.

## General Active Directory Hardening Measures

The [Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899) is used to randomize and rotate local administrator passwords on Windows hosts and prevent lateral movement.

#### LAPS

Accounts can be set up to have their password rotated on a fixed interval (i.e., 12 hours, 24 hours, etc.). This free tool can be beneficial in reducing the impact of an individual compromised host in an AD environment. Organizations should not rely on tools like this alone. Still, when combined with other hardening measures and security best practices, it can be a very effective tool for local administrator account password management.

#### Audit Policy Settings (Logging and Monitoring)

Every organization needs to have logging and monitoring setup to detect and react to unexpected changes or activities that may indicate an attack. Effective logging and monitoring can be used to detect an attacker or unauthorized employee adding a user or computer, modifying an object in AD, changing an account password, accessing a system in an unauthorized or non-standard manner, performing an attack such as password spraying, or more advanced attacks such as modern Kerberos attacks.

#### Group Policy Security Settings

As mentioned earlier in the module, Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are virtual collections of policy settings that can be applied to specific users, groups, and computers at the OU level. These can be used to apply a wide variety of [security policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/security-policy-settings) to help harden Active Directory. The following is a non-exhaustive list of the types of security policies that can be applied:

- [Account Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/account-policies) - Manage how user accounts interact with the domain. These include the password policy, account lockout policy, and Kerberos-related settings such as the lifetime of Kerberos tickets
    
- [Local Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/security-options) - These apply to a specific computer and include the security event audit policy, user rights assignments (user privileges on a host), and specific security settings such as the ability to install drivers, whether the administrator and guest accounts are enabled, renaming the guest and administrator accounts, preventing users from installing printers or using removable media, and a variety of network access and network security controls.
    
- [Software Restriction Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/software-restriction-policies/software-restriction-policies) - Settings to control what software can be run on a host.
    
- [Application Control Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control) - Settings to control which applications can be run by certain users/groups. This may include blocking certain users from running all executables, Windows Installer files, scripts, etc. Administrators use [[5. Standard Information/Operating Systems/Windows/Security/AppLocker|AppLocker]] to restrict access to certain types of applications and files. It is not uncommon to see organizations block access to CMD and PowerShell (among other executables) for users that do not require them for their day-to-day job. These policies are imperfect and can often be bypassed but necessary for a defence-in-depth strategy.
    
- [Advanced Audit Policy Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/secpol-advanced-security-audit-policy-settings) - A variety of settings that can be adjusted to audit activities such as file access or modification, account logon/logoff, policy changes, privilege usage, and more.
