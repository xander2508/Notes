###### Users

These are the users within the organization's AD environment. Users are considered `leaf objects`, which means that they cannot contain any other objects within them. Another example of a leaf object is a mailbox in Microsoft Exchange. A user object is considered a security principal and has a security identifier (SID) and a global unique identifier (GUID). User objects have many possible [attributes](http://www.kouti.com/tables/userattributes.htm), such as their display name, last login time, date of last password change, email address, account description, manager, address, and more. Depending on how a particular Active Directory environment is set up, there can be over 800 possible user attributes when accounting for ALL possible attributes as detailed [here](https://www.easy365manager.com/how-to-get-all-active-directory-user-object-attributes/). This example goes far beyond what is typically populated for a standard user in most environments but shows Active Directory's sheer size and complexity. They are a crucial target for attackers since gaining access to even a low privileged user can grant access to many objects and resources and allow for detailed enumeration of the entire domain (or forest).
