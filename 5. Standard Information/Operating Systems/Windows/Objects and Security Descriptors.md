Every named object in Windows is a [securable object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/securable-objects), and even some unnamed objects are securable. 

 If it's securable in a Windows OS, it will have a [security descriptor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptors). Security descriptors identify the object’s owner and a primary group containing a `Discretionary Access Control List` (`DACL`) and a `System Access Control List` (`SACL`).

Generally, a DACL is used for controlling access to an object, and a SACL is used to account for and log access attempts. This section will examine the DACL, but the same concepts would apply to a SACL.

For more information about SACLs, see [Audit Generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/audit-generation) and [SACL Access Right](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/sacl-access-right)."

```

This amalgamation of characters crunched together and delimited by opened and closed parentheses is in a format known as the `Security Descriptor Definition Language` (`SDDL`).

We may be tempted to read from left to right because that is how the English language is typically written, but it can be much different when interacting with computers. Read the entire security descriptor for the `Windows Update` (`wuauserv`) service in this order starting with the first letter and set of parentheses:

`D: (A;;CCLCSWRPLORC;;;AU)`

1. D: - the proceeding characters are DACL permissions
2. AU: - defines the security principal Authenticated Users
3. A;; - access is allowed
4. CC - SERVICE_QUERY_CONFIG is the full name, and it is a query to the service control manager (SCM) for the service configuration
5. LC - SERVICE_QUERY_STATUS is the full name, and it is a query to the service control manager (SCM) for the current status of the service
6. SW - SERVICE_ENUMERATE_DEPENDENTS is the full name, and it will enumerate a list of dependent services
7. RP - SERVICE_START is the full name, and it will start the service
8. LO - SERVICE_INTERROGATE is the full name, and it will query the service for its current status
9. RC - READ_CONTROL is the full name, and it will query the security descriptor of the service

As we read the security descriptor, it can be easy to get lost in the seemingly random order of characters, but recall that we are essentially viewing access control entries in an access control list. Each set of 2 characters in between the semi-colons represents actions allowed to be performed by a specific user or group.

`;;CCLCSWRPLORC;;;`

After the last set of semi-colons, the characters specify the security principal (User and/or Group) that is permitted to perform those actions.

`;;;AU`

The character immediately after the opening parentheses and before the first set of semi-colons defines whether the actions are Allowed or Denied.

`A;;`

This entire security descriptor associated with the `Windows Update` (`wuauserv`) service has three sets of access control entries because there are three different security principals. Each security principal has specific permissions applied.
