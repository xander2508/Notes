Find below an indicative (non-exhaustive) list of useful Windows event logs.

1. **Windows System Logs**
    
    - [Event ID 1074](https://serverfault.com/questions/885601/windows-event-codes-for-startup-shutdown-lock-unlock) `(System Shutdown/Restart)`: This event log indicates when and why the system was shut down or restarted. By monitoring these events, you can determine if there are unexpected shutdowns or restarts, potentially revealing malicious activity such as malware infection or unauthorized user access.
    - [Event ID 6005](https://superuser.com/questions/1137371/how-to-find-out-if-windows-was-running-at-a-given-time) `(The Event log service was started)`: This event log marks the time when the Event Log Service was started. This is an important record, as it can signify a system boot-up, providing a starting point for investigating system performance or potential security incidents around that period. It can also be used to detect unauthorized system reboots.
    - [Event ID 6006](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/235563/server-issue) `(The Event log service was stopped)`: This event log signifies the moment when the Event Log Service was stopped. It is typically seen when the system is shutting down. Abnormal or unexpected occurrences of this event could point to intentional service disruption for covering illicit activities.
    - [Event ID 6013](https://serverfault.com/questions/885601/windows-event-codes-for-startup-shutdown-lock-unlock) `(Windows uptime)`: This event occurs once a day and shows the uptime of the system in seconds. A shorter than expected uptime could mean the system has been rebooted, which could signify a potential intrusion or unauthorized activities on the system.
    - [Event ID 7040](https://www.slideshare.net/Hackerhurricane/finding-attacks-with-these-6-events) `(Service status change)`: This event indicates a change in service startup type, which could be from manual to automatic or vice versa. If a crucial service's startup type is changed, it could be a sign of system tampering.
2. **Windows Security Logs**
    
    - [Event ID 1102](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=1102) `(The audit log was cleared)`: Clearing the audit log is often a sign of an attempt to remove evidence of an intrusion or malicious activity.

    - [Event ID 4624](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4624) `(Successful Logon)`: This event records successful logon events. This information is vital for establishing normal user behavior. Abnormal behavior, such as logon attempts at odd hours or from different locations, could signify a potential security threat.
    - [Event ID 4625](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4625) `(Failed Logon)`: This event logs failed logon attempts. Multiple failed logon attempts could signify a brute-force attack in progress.
    - [Event ID 4648](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4648) `(A logon was attempted using explicit credentials)`: This event is triggered when a user logs on with explicit credentials to run a program. Anomalies in these logon events could indicate lateral movement within a network, which is a common technique used by attackers.
    - [Event ID 4656](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4656) `(A handle to an object was requested)`: This event is triggered when a handle to an object (like a file, registry key, or process) is requested. This can be a useful event for detecting attempts to access sensitive resources.
    - [Event ID 4672](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4672) `(Special Privileges Assigned to a New Logon)`: This event is logged whenever an account logs on with super user privileges.
