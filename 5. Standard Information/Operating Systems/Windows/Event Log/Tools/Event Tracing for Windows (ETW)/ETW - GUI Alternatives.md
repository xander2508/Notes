## Performance Monitor

Using the graphical interface of the `Performance Monitor` tool, we can visualize various running trace sessions. A detailed overview of a specific trace can be accessed simply by double-clicking on it.

Additionally, these sessions can be modified to suit our needs by incorporating or eliminating providers. Lastly, we can devise new sessions by opting for the "User Defined" category.

## EtwExplorer Project

ETW Provider metadata can also be viewed through the [EtwExplorer project](https://github.com/zodiacon/EtwExplorer).
