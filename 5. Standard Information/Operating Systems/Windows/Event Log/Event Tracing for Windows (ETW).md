`Event Tracing For Windows (ETW)`Â is a general-purpose, high-speed tracing facility provided by the operating system. Using a buffering and logging mechanism implemented in the kernel, ETW provides a tracing mechanism for events raised by both user-mode applications and kernel-mode device drivers.

* `Controllers`: The Controllers component, as its name implies, assumes control over all aspects related to ETW operations. It encompasses functionalities such as initiating and terminating trace sessions, as well as enabling or disabling providers within a particular trace.

At the core of ETW's architecture is the publish-subscribe model. This model involves two primary components:

- `Providers`: Providers play a pivotal role in generating events and writing them to the designated ETW sessions. Applications have the ability to register ETW providers, enabling them to generate and transmit numerous events. There are four distinct types of providers utilized within ETW.
    - `MOF Providers`: These providers are based on Managed Object Format (MOF) and are capable of generating events according to predefined MOF schemas. They offer a flexible approach to event generation and are widely used in various scenarios.
    - `WPP Providers`: Standing for "Windows Software Trace Preprocessor," WPP providers leverage specialized macros and annotations within the application's source code to generate events. This type of provider is often utilized for low-level kernel-mode tracing and debugging purposes.
    - `Manifest-based Providers`: Manifest-based providers represent a more contemporary form of providers within ETW. They rely on XML manifest files that define the structure and characteristics of events. This approach offers enhanced flexibility and ease of management, allowing for dynamic event generation and customization.
    - `TraceLogging Providers`: TraceLogging providers offer a simplified and efficient approach to event generation. They leverage the TraceLogging API, introduced in recent Windows versions, which streamlines the process of event generation with minimal code overhead.
- `Consumers`: Consumers subscribe to specific events of interest and receive those events for further processing or analysis. By default, the events are typically directed to an .ETL (Event Trace Log) file for handling. However, an alternative consumer scenario involves leveraging the capabilities of the Windows API to process and consume the events.
- `Channels`: To facilitate efficient event collection and consumption, ETW relies on event channels. Event channels act as logical containers for organizing and filtering events based on their characteristics and importance. ETW supports multiple channels, each with its own defined purpose and audience. Event consumers can selectively subscribe to specific channels to receive relevant events for their respective use cases.
- `ETL files`: ETW provides specialized support for writing events to disk through the use of event trace log files, commonly referred to as "ETL files." These files serve as durable storage for events, enabling offline analysis, long-term archiving, and forensic investigations. ETW allows for seamless rotation and management of ETL files to ensure efficient storage utilization.
