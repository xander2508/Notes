`Event Tracing For Windows (ETW)` is a general-purpose, high-speed tracing facility provided by the operating system. Using a buffering and logging mechanism implemented in the kernel, ETW provides a tracing mechanism for events raised by both user-mode applications and kernel-mode device drivers.

* `Controllers`: The Controllers component, as its name implies, assumes control over all aspects related to ETW operations. It encompasses functionalities such as initiating and terminating trace sessions, as well as enabling or disabling providers within a particular trace.

At the core of ETW's architecture is the publish-subscribe model. This model involves two primary components:

- `Providers`: Providers play a pivotal role in generating events and writing them to the designated ETW sessions. Applications have the ability to register ETW providers, enabling them to generate and transmit numerous events. There are four distinct types of providers utilized within ETW.
    - `MOF Providers`: These providers are based on Managed Object Format (MOF) and are capable of generating events according to predefined MOF schemas. They offer a flexible approach to event generation and are widely used in various scenarios.
    - `WPP Providers`: Standing for "Windows Software Trace Preprocessor," WPP providers leverage specialized macros and annotations within the application's source code to generate events. This type of provider is often utilized for low-level kernel-mode tracing and debugging purposes.
    - `Manifest-based Providers`: Manifest-based providers represent a more contemporary form of providers within ETW. They rely on XML manifest files that define the structure and characteristics of events. This approach offers enhanced flexibility and ease of management, allowing for dynamic event generation and customization.
    - `TraceLogging Providers`: TraceLogging providers offer a simplified and efficient approach to event generation. They leverage the TraceLogging API, introduced in recent Windows versions, which streamlines the process of event generation with minimal code overhead.
- `Consumers`: Consumers subscribe to specific events of interest and receive those events for further processing or analysis. By default, the events are typically directed to an .ETL (Event Trace Log) file for handling. However, an alternative consumer scenario involves leveraging the capabilities of the Windows API to process and consume the events.
- `Channels`: To facilitate efficient event collection and consumption, ETW relies on event channels. Event channels act as logical containers for organizing and filtering events based on their characteristics and importance. ETW supports multiple channels, each with its own defined purpose and audience. Event consumers can selectively subscribe to specific channels to receive relevant events for their respective use cases.
- `ETL files`: ETW provides specialized support for writing events to disk through the use of event trace log files, commonly referred to as "ETL files." These files serve as durable storage for events, enabling offline analysis, long-term archiving, and forensic investigations. ETW allows for seamless rotation and management of ETL files to ensure efficient storage utilization.

### Notes 

- ETW supports event providers in both kernel mode and user mode.
- Some event providers generate a significant volume of events, which can potentially overwhelm the system resources if they are constantly active. As a result, to prevent unnecessary resource consumption, these providers are typically disabled by default and are only enabled when a tracing session specifically requests their activation.
- In addition to its inherent capabilities, ETW can be extended through custom event providers.
- [Only ETW provider events that have a Channel property applied to them can be consumed by the event log](https://medium.com/threat-hunters-forge/threat-hunting-with-etw-events-and-helk-part-1-installing-silketw-6eb74815e4a0)


# Interacting With ETW

`Logman` is a pre-installed utility for managing Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) and Event Tracing Sessions.

Employing the `-ets` parameter will allow for a direct investigation of the event tracing sessions, providing insights into system-wide tracing sessions.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that the “-ets” parameter is vital to the command. Without it, Logman will not identify the Event Tracing Session.

```cmd-session
C:\Tools> logman.exe query -ets

For each provider subscribed to the session, we can acquire critical data:

- `Name / Provider GUID`: This is the exclusive identifier for the provider.
- `Level`: This describes the event level, indicating if it's filtering for warning, informational, critical, or all events.
- `Keywords Any`: Keywords create a filter based on the kind of event generated by the provider.

### List Providers

By using the `logman query providers` command, we can generate a list of all available providers on the system, including their respective GUIDs.

```cmd-session
C:\Tools> logman.exe query providers

Provider                                 GUID
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACPI Driver Trace Provider               {DAB01D4D-2D48-477D-B1C3-DAAD0CE6F06B}
Active Directory Domain Services: SAM    {8E598056-8993-11D2-819E-0000F875A064}
Active Directory: Kerberos Client        {BBA3ADD2-C229-4CDB-AE2B-57EB6966B0C4}

--- SNIP ---
The command completed successfully.
```

#### Filter Providers 

Due to the high number of providers, it's usually advantageous to filter them using `findstr`. For instance, you will see multiple results for "Winlogon" in the given example.

```cmd-session
C:\Tools> logman.exe query providers | findstr "Winlogon"
Microsoft-Windows-Winlogon               {DBE9B383-7CF3-4331-91CC-A3CB16A3B538}
Windows Winlogon Trace                   {D451642C-63A6-11D7-9720-00B0D03E0347}
```

By specifying a provider with Logman, we gain a deeper understanding of the provider's function. This will inform us about the Keywords we can filter on, the available event levels, and which processes are currently utilizing the provider.

```cmd-session
logman.exe query providers Microsoft-Windows-Winlogon

Provider                                 GUID
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SilkETW

[GitHub - mandiant/SilkETW](https://github.com/mandiant/SilkETW)

SilkETW & SilkService are flexible C# wrappers for ETW, they are meant to abstract away the complexities of ETW and give people a simple interface to perform research and introspection. While both projects have obvious defensive (and offensive) applications they should primarily be considered as research tools.

For easy consumption, output data is serialized to JSON. The JSON data can either be written to file and analysed locally using PowerShell, stored in the Windows eventlog or shipped off to 3rd party infrastructure such as [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/).

```cmd-session
SilkETW.exe -t user -pn Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process -ot file -p C:\windows\temp\etw.json
```
## GUI Alternatives

## Performance Monitor

Using the graphical interface of the `Performance Monitor` tool, we can visualize various running trace sessions. A detailed overview of a specific trace can be accessed simply by double-clicking on it.

Additionally, these sessions can be modified to suit our needs by incorporating or eliminating providers. Lastly, we can devise new sessions by opting for the "User Defined" category.

## EtwExplorer Project

ETW Provider metadata can also be viewed through the [EtwExplorer project](https://github.com/zodiacon/EtwExplorer).


# Useful Providers

- `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process`: This ETW provider is instrumental in monitoring process-related activity within the Windows kernel. It can aid in detecting unusual process behaviors such as process injection, process hollowing, and other tactics commonly used by malware and advanced persistent threats (APTs).
- `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-File`: As the name suggests, this provider focuses on file-related operations. It can be employed for detection scenarios involving unauthorized file access, changes to critical system files, or suspicious file operations indicative of exfiltration or ransomware activity.
- `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Network`: This ETW provider offers visibility into network-related activity at the kernel level. It's especially useful in detecting network-based attacks such as data exfiltration, unauthorized network connections, and potential signs of command and control (C2) communication.
- `Microsoft-Windows-SMBClient/SMBServer`: These providers monitor Server Message Block (SMB) client and server activity, providing insights into file sharing and network communication. They can be used to detect unusual SMB traffic patterns, potentially indicating lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- `Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime`: This provider focuses on .NET runtime events, making it ideal for identifying anomalies in .NET application execution, potential exploitation of .NET vulnerabilities, or malicious .NET assembly loading.
- `OpenSSH`: Monitoring the OpenSSH ETW provider can provide important insights into Secure Shell (SSH) connection attempts, successful and failed authentications, and potential brute force attacks.
- `Microsoft-Windows-VPN-Client`: This provider enables tracking of Virtual Private Network (VPN) client events. It can be useful for identifying unauthorized or suspicious VPN connections.
- `Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell`: This ETW provider tracks PowerShell execution and command activity, making it invaluable for detecting suspicious PowerShell usage, script block logging, and potential misuse or exploitation.
- `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Registry`: This provider monitors registry operations, making it useful for detection scenarios related to changes in registry keys, often associated with persistence mechanisms, malware installation, or system configuration changes.
- `Microsoft-Windows-CodeIntegrity`: This provider monitors code and driver integrity checks, which can be key in identifying attempts to load unsigned or malicious drivers or code.
- `Microsoft-Antimalware-Service`: This ETW provider can be employed to detect potential issues with the antimalware service, including disabled services, configuration changes, or potential evasion techniques employed by malware.
- `WinRM`: Monitoring the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) provider can reveal unauthorized or suspicious remote management activity, often indicative of lateral movement or remote command execution.
- `Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager`: This provider tracks local Terminal Services sessions, making it useful for detecting unauthorized or suspicious remote desktop activity.
- `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Mitigations`: This provider keeps tabs on the effectiveness and operations of security mitigations in place. It's essential for identifying potential bypass attempts of these security controls.
- `Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client`: This ETW provider gives visibility into DNS client activity, which is crucial for detecting DNS-based attacks, including DNS tunneling or unusual DNS requests that may indicate C2 communication.
- `Microsoft-Antimalware-Protection`: This provider monitors the operations of antimalware protection mechanisms. It can be used to detect any issues with these mechanisms, such as disabled protection features, configuration changes, or signs of evasion techniques employed by malicious actors.

# Restricted Providers

In the realm of Windows operating system security, certain ETW providers are considered "restricted." These providers offer valuable telemetry but are only accessible to processes that carry the requisite permissions. This exclusivity is designed to ensure that sensitive system data remains shielded from potential threats.

## Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence

The Threat-Intelligence (TI) provider is a manifest-based ETW provider that generates security-related events. The TI provider is unique in the sense that Microsoft seems to continuously update this to provide more information around operations that would take some extreme engineering to obtain (i.e. function hooking) in the kernel.

The `Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence` ETW Provider is an excellent tool to [detect process injection](https://blog.redbluepurple.io/windows-security-research/kernel-tracing-injection-detection), and other type of attacks. Unlike `usermode` hooking or in-process ETW Providers, avoiding or tampering with the `Threat-Intelligence` is very difficult.

However, to subscribe to this Provider requires a process with very special privileges, marked as [Protected Process Light (PPL)](https://www.alex-ionescu.com/?p=97) 'Anti-Malware' or higher. To legitimately run a program at this level you must submit a driver to Microsoft to be co-signed by them, something not everyone has the inclination or reputation to do.

This provider can record highly granular data about potential threats, enabling security professionals to detect and analyze sophisticated attacks that may have eluded other defenses. Its telemetry can serve as vital evidence in forensic investigations, revealing details about the origin of a threat, the systems and data it interacted with, and the alterations it made. Moreover, by monitoring this provider in real-time, security teams can potentially identify ongoing threats and intervene to mitigate damage.

# Using ETW Examples

## Detection Example 1: Detecting Strange Parent-Child Relationships

In standard Windows environments, certain processes never call or spawn others. For example, it is highly unlikely to see "calc.exe" spawning "cmd.exe" in a normal Windows environment.

Analysing relationships in standard and custom environments enables us to identify deviations from normal patterns. For example, if we observe the "spoolsv.exe" process creating "whoami.exe" instead of its expected behaviour of creating a "conhost", it raises suspicion.

![[image35.webp]]

To showcase a strange parent-child relationship, where "cmd.exe" appears to be created by "spoolsv.exe" `with no accompanying arguments`, we will utilize an attacking technique called Parent PID Spoofing. Parent PID Spoofing ([[Impersonate Users]]) can be executed through the [[PsGetSystem]] the following manner.

Let's begin by collecting data from the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process` provider using [SilkETW](https://github.com/mandiant/SilkETW) (the provider can be identified using `logman` as we described previously, `logman.exe query providers | findstr "Process"`). After that, we can proceed to simulate the attack again to assess whether ETW can provide us with more accurate information regarding the execution of `cmd.exe`.
