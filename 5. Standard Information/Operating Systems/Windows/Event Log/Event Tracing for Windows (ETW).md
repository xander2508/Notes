`Event Tracing For Windows (ETW)`Â is a general-purpose, high-speed tracing facility provided by the operating system. Using a buffering and logging mechanism implemented in the kernel, ETW provides a tracing mechanism for events raised by both user-mode applications and kernel-mode device drivers.

* `Controllers`: The Controllers component, as its name implies, assumes control over all aspects related to ETW operations. It encompasses functionalities such as initiating and terminating trace sessions, as well as enabling or disabling providers within a particular trace.

At the core of ETW's architecture is the publish-subscribe model. This model involves two primary components:

- `Providers`: Providers play a pivotal role in generating events and writing them to the designated ETW sessions. Applications have the ability to register ETW providers, enabling them to generate and transmit numerous events. There are four distinct types of providers utilized within ETW.
    - `MOF Providers`: These providers are based on Managed Object Format (MOF) and are capable of generating events according to predefined MOF schemas. They offer a flexible approach to event generation and are widely used in various scenarios.
    - `WPP Providers`: Standing for "Windows Software Trace Preprocessor," WPP providers leverage specialized macros and annotations within the application's source code to generate events. This type of provider is often utilized for low-level kernel-mode tracing and debugging purposes.
    - `Manifest-based Providers`: Manifest-based providers represent a more contemporary form of providers within ETW. They rely on XML manifest files that define the structure and characteristics of events. This approach offers enhanced flexibility and ease of management, allowing for dynamic event generation and customization.
    - `TraceLogging Providers`: TraceLogging providers offer a simplified and efficient approach to event generation. They leverage the TraceLogging API, introduced in recent Windows versions, which streamlines the process of event generation with minimal code overhead.
