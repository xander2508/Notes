The MMC can be used to group snap-ins, or administrative tools, to manage hardware, software, and network components within a Windows host. We can also use MMC to create custom tools and distribute them to users. MMC works with the concept of snap-ins, allowing administrators to create a customized console with only the administrative tools needed to manage several services. These snap-ins can be added to manage both local and remote systems.

We can open MMC by just typing `mmc` in the Start menu. When we open MMC for the first time, it will be blank.
