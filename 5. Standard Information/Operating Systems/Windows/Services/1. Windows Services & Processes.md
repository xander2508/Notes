Services are a major component of the Windows operating system. They allow for the creation and management of long-running processes. Windows services can be started automatically at system boot without user intervention. These services can continue to run in the background even after the user logs out of their account on the system.

Windows services are managed via the Service Control Manager (SCM) system, accessible via the `services.msc` MMC add-in.

It is also possible to query and manage services via the command line using `sc.exe` using [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7) cmdlets such as `Get-Service`.

```powershell-session
Get-Service | ? {$_.Status -eq "Running"} | select -First 2 |fl
```

Windows has three categories of services: Local Services, Network Services, and System Services.

In Windows, we have some [critical system services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/rstmgr/critical-system-services) that cannot be stopped and restarted without a system restart. If we update any file or resource in use by one of these services, we must restart the system.

|Service|Description|
|---|---|
|smss.exe|Session Manager SubSystem. Responsible for handling sessions on the system.|
|csrss.exe|Client Server Runtime Process. The user-mode portion of the Windows subsystem.|
|wininit.exe|Starts the Wininit file .ini file that lists all of the changes to be made to Windows when the computer is restarted after installing a program.|
|logonui.exe|Used for facilitating user login into a PC|
|lsass.exe|The Local Security Authentication Server verifies the validity of user logons to a PC or server. It generates the process responsible for authenticating users for the Winlogon service.|
|services.exe|Manages the operation of starting and stopping services.|
|winlogon.exe|Responsible for handling the secure attention sequence, loading a user profile on logon, and locking the computer when a screensaver is running.|
|System|A background system process that runs the Windows kernel.|
|svchost.exe with RPCSS|Manages system services that run from dynamic-link libraries (files with the extension .dll) such as "Automatic Updates," "Windows Firewall," and "Plug and Play." Uses the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service (RPCSS).|
|svchost.exe with Dcom/PnP|Manages system services that run from dynamic-link libraries (files with the extension .dll) such as "Automatic Updates," "Windows Firewall," and "Plug and Play." Uses the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) and Plug and Play (PnP) services.|

## Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)

`lsass.exe` is the process that is responsible for enforcing the security policy on Windows systems. When a user attempts to log on to the system, this process verifies their log on attempt and creates access tokens based on the user's permission levels. LSASS is also responsible for user account password changes. All events associated with this process (logon/logoff attempts, etc.) are logged within the Windows Security Log. LSASS is an extremely high-value target as several tools exist to extract both cleartext and hashed credentials stored in memory by this process.
