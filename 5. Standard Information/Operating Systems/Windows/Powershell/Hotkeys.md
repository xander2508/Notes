| `CTRL+R`           | It makes for a searchable history. We can start typing after, and it will show us results that match previous commands.                             |
| `CTRL+L`           | Quick screen clear.                                                                                                                                 |
| `CTRL+ALT+Shift+?` | This will print the entire list of keyboard shortcuts PowerShell will recognize.                                                                    |
| `Escape`           | When typing into the CLI, if you wish to clear the entire line, instead of holding backspace, you can just hit `escape`, which will erase the line. |
| `↑`                | Scroll up through our previous history.                                                                                                             |
| `↓`                | Scroll down through our previous history.                                                                                                           |
| `F7`               | Brings up a TUI with a scrollable interactive history from our session.                                                                             |
