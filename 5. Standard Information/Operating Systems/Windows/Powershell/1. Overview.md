PowerShell is a powerful automation tool and scripting language developed by Microsoft for managing and configuring Windows operating systems. 

It provides a command-line interface that allows users to automate tasks, manage system configurations, and perform administrative tasks more efficiently. PowerShell uses cmdlets, which are small scripts that perform specific functions, to execute tasks and manipulate data on the system. It also supports the use of scripts and modules to extend its functionality and automate complex processes. Overall, PowerShell is a versatile tool for system administrators and IT professionals to streamline their workflows and manage Windows environments effectively.
