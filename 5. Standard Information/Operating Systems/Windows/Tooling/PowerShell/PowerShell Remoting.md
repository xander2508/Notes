[PowerShell Remoting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/running-remote-commands?view=powershell-7.2) allows us to run scripts or commands on a remote computer. Administrators often use PowerShell Remoting to manage remote computers on the network. Enabling PowerShell Remoting creates both HTTP and HTTPS listeners. The listener runs on standard port TCP/5985 for HTTP and TCP/5986 for HTTPS.

To create a PowerShell Remoting session on a remote computer, you must have administrative permissions, be a member of the Remote Management Users group, or have explicit PowerShell Remoting permissions in your session configuration.

Suppose we find a user account that doesn't have administrative privileges on a remote computer but is a member of the Remote Management Users group. In that case, we can use PowerShell Remoting to connect to that computer and execute commands.

```cmd-session
powershell
```

```cmd-session
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DC01
```
