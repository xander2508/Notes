APK reverse engineering involves analyzing, decompiling, and modifying APK files. By doing so, we can study an application's inner workings, identify vulnerabilities, and alter its behavior.

### Key Tools

- **APK Tool**: A powerful utility for:
    - Decompiling APK files into human-readable formats.
    - Modifying code, resources, and rebuilding APKs.
    - Decoding Android resources like `AndroidManifest.xml`, layouts, images, and strings.
### Workflow:

1. **Decompiling APK Files**:
    
    - Use the command:
        
        ```
        apktool d <apk_file> -o <output_folder>
        ```
        
        - `d` stands for decompile.
            
        - `-o` specifies the output folder for decompiled files.
            
2. **Inspecting Decompiled Files**:
    
    - Key files include:
        
        - `AndroidManifest.xml`: Lists package names, permissions, activities, services, and receivers.
            
        - `res/`: Contains resource files like layouts, strings, and images.
            
        - `smali/`: Contains Smali code, the human-readable version of Dalvik bytecode.
            
3. **Rebuilding the APK**:
    
    - After modifications, rebuild the APK using:
        
        ```
        apktool b <output_folder>
        ```
        
4. **Analyzing Smali Code**:
    
    - Smali is an intermediate representation of Android bytecode.
        
    - Acts as a low-level representation akin to assembly language.
