# AOSP Directory Overview

## 1. Android Runtime Compiler Directories

### Compiler Directory
- **Files**:
  - `compiler.cc`: Primary implementation file for the Android Runtime compiler. It contains the core logic for translating Dalvik bytecode into optimized machine code. Essential for runtime performance.
  - `CFI_test.h`: Defines tests for Control Flow Integrity (CFI), a security feature ensuring control flow follows legitimate paths, preventing exploits like hijacking.
  - `exception_test.cc`: Tests the proper handling of exceptions in the runtime compiler.
  - `compiler_reflection_test.cc`: Ensures correct handling of reflection, a feature for inspecting and invoking code dynamically.
- **Subdirectories**:
  - **Debug**: Debugging support, including tools like `elf_debug_writer.cc` for writing ELF debugging information.
  - **JIT**: Implements the Just-In-Time compiler for real-time code optimization (e.g., `jit_compiler.cc`, `jit_compiler.h`).
  - **JNI**: Manages Java Native Interface interactions. Key files include `jni_compiler.cc` and `calling_convention.cc`.
  - **Linker**: Links compiled machine code with other runtime components, facilitating integration.
  - **Optimizing**: Implements advanced optimizations like inlining, constant folding, and dead code elimination. Key files include `dead_code_elimination.cc` and `load_store_analysis.cc`.
  - **Utils**: Provides utility functions like `assembler.cc`, `jni_macro_assembler.cc`, and prototype implementations such as `stack_check.h`.

### Additional Directories
- **Dex2Oat**: 
  - Performs Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation, converting Dalvik bytecode to native machine code optimized for specific CPU architectures.
  - **Key Features**:
    - Parses `.dex` files, generates intermediate representation (IR), applies optimizations, and emits architecture-specific machine code.
    - Works closely with the **Optimizing** directory for performance enhancements such as instruction selection and register allocation.
    - Uses configurations for multi-architecture support and device-specific performance tuning.
  - **Key Files**:
    - `dex2oat.cc`: Main implementation of the AOT compiler.
    - `dex2oat_test.cc`: Validates AOT compilation process.
- **DexDump**: A debugging utility to inspect DEX file contents, including metadata and class structures (`dexdump.cc`).
- **LibNativeBridge**: Facilitates compatibility by running native code compiled for different architectures.
- **LibNativeLoader**: Handles loading and linking shared libraries (`.so` files) for Android applications.
- **OatDump**: Reads `.oat` files, extracting human-readable information for diagnostics and optimization analysis (`oatdump.cc`).

## 2. Core System Directories

### ART Directory
- **Runtime**: Implements core runtime functionality such as:
  - Garbage Collection (GC).
  - Threading.
  - Signal handling.
  - Class loading and runtime error management.
- **Tools**: Contains tools for testing and debugging, including `DexFuzz`, `JFuzz`, and `DexAnalyze`.

### Bionic Directory
- Implements Android's C library (`libc`), threading library, and dynamic linker.
- **Subdirectories**:
  - `libc`: Source code for standard C functions like file I/O and string manipulation.
  - `linker`: Dynamic linker resolving shared libraries during runtime.
  - `test`: Unit tests for validating Bionic functionality.

### Bootable Directory
- Houses components essential for booting Android devices.
- **Subdirectories**:
  - `libbootloader`: Generic bootloader utilities (e.g., `gbl` for Bazel workspaces).
  - `libxbc`: Extended Boot Control for boot image management.
  - `recovery`: Contains recovery image files and utilities.

### Build Directory
- **Key Files**:
  - `env_setup.sh`: Configures the environment for building Android.
  - **Core**: Contains scripts for compiling system components like the kernel.
  - **Target**: Hardware-specific build configurations (`board_config.mk`, `devices.mk`).
- **Build Systems**:
  - **Blueprint**: Declarative build system using `.bp` files.
  - **Bazel**: High-performance build system for large codebases.

## 3. Testing and Development Directories

### CTS (Compatibility Test Suite)
- Validates device compatibility with the Android Compatibility Definition Document (CDD).
- **Subdirectories**:
  - `apps`: Test applications for features like the camera.
  - `host_side_tests`: Run CTS tests on host machines.
  - `test`: Scripts for automated testing on devices.

### Dalvik Directory
- Contains legacy source code for Dalvik VM.
- **Subdirectories**:
  - `DexGen`: Generates DEX files from Java bytecode for older Android versions.
  - `dx`: Converts Java bytecode into Dalvik-compatible DEX files.

### Development Directory
- Tools and resources for Android platform developers.
- **Subdirectories**:
  - `apps`: Example applications and development utilities.

## 4. Device and External Libraries

### Device Directory
- Includes device-specific configurations and drivers.
- **Examples**:
  - `raven`: Configuration files for Pixel 6.
  - `lynx`: Configuration files for Pixel 7a.
  - `turtlefish`: Emulator-specific configurations.

### External Directory
- Third-party libraries used by Android.
- **Examples**:
  - `AFL++`: Fuzzing framework for testing security.
  - `protobuf`: Protocol buffer serialization framework.
  - `pthreadpool`: Thread pooling for efficient multithreading.
