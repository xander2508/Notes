## Overview

Memory management is a critical component of Android's system design, directly affecting performance, resource utilization, and security. Over the years, Android has evolved its memory allocators to address the increasing complexity of mobile applications, higher performance demands, and growing concerns around security vulnerabilities.

## **Traditional Memory Allocators**

### 1. **DLMalloc**

- **Role:** Initially used in early Android versions due to its simplicity and hardware efficiency.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Minimal overhead, suitable for resource-constrained environments.
    - Prioritized efficiency over advanced multitasking or security features.
- **Limitations:**
    - Ineffective in handling complex applications and multithreading scenarios.
    - Lack of safeguards against heap-related security vulnerabilities.

### 2. **JEMalloc**

- **Adoption:** Replaced DLMalloc to address performance issues and scaling challenges as applications grew in complexity.
- **Improvements:**
    - Per-thread caching for faster allocations.
    - Reduced memory fragmentation, improving memory efficiency.
    - Better performance in multithreaded environments.
- **Security Shortcomings:**
    - Vulnerabilities to heap-based attacks such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, and heap corruption.
    - Limited defenses against metadata manipulation or predictable allocation patterns.

## **Limitations of Traditional Allocators**

### 1. **Metadata Exposure**

Traditional allocators maintain internal metadata adjacent to user-accessible data. This metadata contains:

- **Size Field:** Tracks allocated block size.
- **State Flags:** Indicates whether a block is allocated or free.
- **Pointers:** Link to adjacent free blocks for merging and memory management.

**Risks:**

- **Buffer Overflows:** Writing beyond allocated memory can overwrite metadata.
- **Exploitation Techniques:**
    - **Size Field Manipulation:** Enlarges free blocks, merging them with adjacent blocks and allowing out-of-bounds writes.
    - **State Flag Corruption:** Tricks the allocator into misinterpreting block status, leading to double-free or memory leaks.
    - **Fake Chunks:** Attackers create forged memory chunks to redirect allocations and writes.

**Examples of Exploits:**

- **Unlink Exploitation:** Manipulates forward and backward pointers in the free list to achieve arbitrary memory writes.
- **Function Pointer Corruption:** Overwrites metadata to redirect execution flow to attacker-controlled code.

---

### 2. **Predictable Allocation Patterns**

Traditional allocators often exhibit deterministic behaviors, making them vulnerable to manipulation.

**Patterns:**

- **Sequential Allocations:** Memory is allocated in contiguous blocks, making locations predictable.
- **First-Fit Strategy:** Allocator uses the first available block that meets the size requirement, creating consistency in block placement.
- **Reuse Patterns:** Freed memory is reused predictably, exposing vulnerabilities like use-after-free.

**Attack Strategies:**

- **Heap Spraying:** Fills memory with attacker-controlled payloads at predictable locations, increasing exploitation success.
- **Heap Feng Shui:** Manipulates memory allocation order to place critical objects near vulnerable regions.

---

### 3. **Lack of Integrity Checks**

Allocators like DLMalloc and JEMalloc assume metadata consistency without validating it during operations.

**Consequences:**

- Silent heap structure corruption.
- Exploits through techniques like:
    - **Unlink Exploitation:** Corrupted pointers lead to arbitrary memory writes.
    - **Flag Manipulation:** Overrides metadata checks, bypassing double-free protections.

**Example:**

- An attacker manipulates free chunk pointers, causing the allocator to write controlled data to critical addresses during memory operations.

---

### 4. **Immediate Memory Reuse**

Traditional allocators immediately reallocate freed memory, introducing risks like use-after-free and type confusion.

**Exploitation Techniques:**

- **Reallocating Freed Memory:** Attackers induce reuse of freed memory for malicious payloads.
- **Type Confusion:** Allocating objects of different types in the same memory region causes misinterpretation, leading to undefined behavior.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data from previous allocations is exposed to new allocations.

**Real-World Example:**

- A password manager fails to zero out memory during deallocation, exposing passwords to subsequent allocations.

## **Transition to Scudo**

### Why Android Adopted Scudo

- Addressed the limitations of DLMalloc and JEMalloc.
- Combined enhanced security with efficient memory management to mitigate heap vulnerabilities.

---

## **Scudo: A Hardened Memory Allocator**

### 1. **Dynamic Allocation Strategies**

- **Primary Allocator:** Handles frequent small-to-medium-sized allocations efficiently.
- **Secondary Allocator:** Manages large memory requests for resource-intensive operations.

### 2. **Chunk Metadata**

Each memory block in Scudo has a header with robust metadata for management and security:

- **Class ID:** Maps memory requests to size classes, reducing fragmentation.
- **State Field:** Tracks allocation status (allocated, free, or quarantined).
- **Origin/Zeroed Field:** Identifies the allocation method or whether memory was cleared.
- **Checksum:** Ensures integrity of metadata.

---

## **Scudo’s Key Security Features**

### 1. **Integrity Verification with Checksum**

- Validates chunk metadata to detect tampering or corruption.
- Uses a secret key known only to the allocator.
- Detects mismatches caused by buffer overflows or deliberate attacks.

**Mechanism:**

- Checksums are calculated during allocation, excluding the checksum field itself.
- Any alteration invalidates the checksum, triggering termination of the process to prevent further exploitation.

---

### 2. **Quarantine Mechanism**

- Temporarily isolates freed memory, preventing immediate reuse.
- Reduces the risk of use-after-free attacks by ensuring corrupted memory is not accessible.

---

### 3. **Controlled Allocation Patterns**

- Maps memory requests to predefined size classes, optimizing performance and reducing fragmentation.
- Randomizes memory allocation to prevent predictable patterns.

---

### 4. **Protection Against Buffer Overflows**

- Metadata placement and checksums ensure overflows are detected and mitigated.
- Corrupted metadata invalidates the checksum, prompting termination.

## **Conclusion**

Scudo represents a major advancement in Android memory management, bridging the gap between security and performance. By addressing vulnerabilities in traditional allocators, Scudo enhances Android’s resilience against modern exploitation techniques, ensuring robust protection against heap-related attacks.
