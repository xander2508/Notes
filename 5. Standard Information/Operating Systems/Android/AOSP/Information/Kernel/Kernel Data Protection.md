## Privilege Escalation Overview

### Concept

Privilege escalation occurs when an attacker exploits system vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized control over system resources, exceeding their intended access permissions.

### General Privilege Escalation Process

1. **Leaking Kernel Pointer:**
    
    - Exploit vulnerabilities to bypass Kernel Space Layout Randomization (KSLR).
    - KSLR randomizes memory addresses, making it harder for attackers to predict kernel data locations.
2. **Exploiting Memory Corruption:**
    
    - Use memory corruption vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary kernel memory read/write capabilities.
    - These vulnerabilities allow direct manipulation of kernel memory, including sensitive structures.
3. **Locating and Modifying `task_struct`:**
    
    - Identify the `task_struct` structure in memory, which represents processes in the kernel.
    - Use its offset to locate the `cred` structure, containing key fields such as UID (user ID) and GID (group ID).
    - Modify these fields to escalate privileges (e.g., change UID to 0 for root access).
4. **Bypassing SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux):**
    
    - Most modern Android devices enable SELinux, which restricts process access to sensitive information.
    - Attackers can override `selinux_enforcing` or `selinux_enabled` flags to disable SELinux protections.
5. **Achieving Full Privileges:**
    
    - With full control, attackers can:
        - Read kernel memory.
        - Modify system files.
        - Install persistent backdoors.

### Challenges with Generic Android Kernel

- Critical data structures like `cred` and `selinux_enforcing` are mutable, lacking protections.
- Attackers can exploit these structures for privilege escalation after gaining kernel read/write access.

## Samsung’s Advanced Kernel Protections

To address the vulnerabilities in the generic Android kernel, Samsung introduced **Kernel Data Protection (KDP)** and **Real-Time Kernel Protection (RKP)**.

### Kernel Data Protection (KDP)

1. **Purpose:**
    
    - Prevent unauthorized modifications to critical kernel data structures at both boot and runtime.
2. **Implementation:**
    
    - Uses a **hypervisor** to enforce **read-only access** on sensitive kernel structures.
    - Attributes like `__KDP_RO` mark data structures as immutable.
    - Examples:
        - `cred` structure.
        - `selinux_enforcing` and `selinux_enabled`.
3. **Impact:**
    
    - Once marked immutable, these structures cannot be altered, even if kernel vulnerabilities are exploited.

### Real-Time Kernel Protection (RKP)

1. **Purpose:**
    
    - Continuously monitor kernel execution to detect and prevent tampering attempts on critical data structures.
2. **Implementation:**
    
    - Marks critical variables as read-only using attributes like `__KDP_RO` and `__RKP_RO`.
    - Example files and fields:
        - `security.h`: `selinux_enabled` and `selinux_enforcing` marked as read-only.
        - `hooks.c`: `task_security_struct` and `selinux_enforcing_boot` fields set as read-only.
3. **Enhanced Security Through RKP:**
    
    - Immutable memory pages for sensitive credentials prevent unauthorized changes.
    - Coupled with KDP, it ensures robust protection against privilege escalation attacks.

## Advanced Reference Counting Mechanisms

### Securing Reference Counts

- Reference counting tracks how many active references exist for a resource, ensuring proper allocation and deallocation.
- Vulnerabilities in reference counting can lead to use-after-free or double-free attacks.

### Samsung's Enhancements

1. **Dedicated Functions:**
    
    - `ROCREDUCINC` and `ROCREDUCDEC` secure against reference counting attacks.
    - These functions are specifically designed for immutable credentials.
2. **Credential Allocation:**
    
    - Separate caches:
        - `cred_jar`: For mutable credentials.
        - `cred_jar_RO`: For immutable credentials.
    - Immutable credentials use specialized reference counting mechanisms, reducing attack surfaces.

---

## Credential Validation and Integrity

### Validation Functions

- **`validateProcessCreds`:**
    - Ensures the validity of real and effective credentials.
    - Checks reference counts to prevent inconsistencies.
- **`creds_are_invalid`:**
    - Detects anomalies in the credential structure.
    - Verifies fields like magic numbers and memory pointers.

### Handling Invalid Credentials

1. **Response:**
    
    - Log errors, providing details about the invalid credentials.
    - Trigger a kernel panic to halt the system and prevent further exploitation.
2. **Debugging Support:**
    
    - Functions like `dump_invalid_creds` provide exhaustive dumps of credential states, aiding in tracing anomalies.

## Memory Management and Segregation

### Segregation of Credential Caches

- **RKP introduces separate caches:**
    - `cred_jar_RO`: Stores immutable credentials.
    - `cred_jar`: Handles mutable credentials.
- Segregation reduces risks of accidental or malicious modifications.

### Use of Read-Copy Update (RCU)

- **RCU ensures safe concurrent access:**
    - `put_cred_RCU`: Safely deallocates credentials without race conditions.
    - RCU callbacks defer deallocation until all references are safely released.

### Credential Assignment

- **Functions like `commit_creds` and `override_creds`:**
    - Validate credentials before assignment.
    - Use RCU mechanisms to ensure atomic updates, preventing race conditions.

---

## Security Against Credential Manipulation

### Ensuring Immutable Credentials

1. **Preparation of Read-Only Credentials:**
    
    - `prepare_RO_creds` creates immutable versions of credentials.
    - Immutable credentials are assigned using RCU mechanisms.
2. **Preventing Persistent Changes:**
    
    - Functions like `override_creds` securely manage temporary credential changes.
    - Immutability ensures attackers cannot inject malicious modifications.

## Key Advantages of Samsung’s Security Framework

### KDP Benefits

- Immutable critical kernel structures block privilege escalation even in the presence of vulnerabilities.
- Protection starts from system boot and persists through runtime.

### RKP Benefits

- Real-time monitoring detects and prevents tampering attempts dynamically.
- Segregation of immutable and mutable structures reduces attack surfaces.

### Combined Impact

- Enhanced defense against both privilege escalation and kernel-level exploits.
- A robust architecture that mitigates risks associated with generic Android kernel vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

Samsung’s **KDP** and **RKP** provide a multi-layered defense mechanism, addressing fundamental flaws in the generic Android kernel. By enforcing immutability, segregating memory caches, and leveraging real-time monitoring, these protections significantly raise the bar for attackers, ensuring a more secure Android ecosystem.
