## 1. **Frameworks Directory**

The `frameworks` directory contains the core components of the Android operating system. Key subdirectories include:

- **Base**: Houses foundational components, such as:
    
    - **Activity Manager**: Responsible for managing application lifecycle (`ActivityManagerService.java`). It plays a central role in the Android operating system by interacting with the **Window Manager** to control app windows and transitions, and with the **Process List** to efficiently allocate system resources and manage foreground and background processes. This ensures smooth task switching and resource optimization across applications.
        
    - **Package Manager**: Manages app installation, permissions, and visibility (`PackageManagerService.java`). It is responsible for parsing APK files during installation, verifying digital signatures for security, and assigning permissions requested by applications. The Package Manager also enforces visibility rules, ensuring apps can only access or interact with other apps when appropriate. Additionally, it integrates with the Permission Manager to dynamically manage runtime permissions granted by the user.
        
    - **Window Manager**: Handles window operations (`WindowManagerService.java`).
        
    - **Content Provider Helper**: Facilitates secure and efficient data sharing between apps (`ContentProviderHelper.java`).
        
    - **Process List**: Tracks and manages active processes (`ProcessList.java`).
        
- **Services**: Implements key system services like activity management, window management, and package management.
    
    - **Permission Manager**: Manages runtime permissions (`PermissionManagerService.java`, `PermissionManagerServiceImpl.java`).

## 2. **AV Directory**

Located inside `frameworks`, this subdirectory contains the audio-video framework for Android:

- **Media Player Service**: The central class for media playback (`MediaPlayerService.cpp`). For example, during video playback, this service interacts with video codecs to decode the video stream into frames and audio codecs to decode the accompanying sound. It manages buffering, synchronizes audio and video streams, and communicates with the rendering engine to display video frames on the screen. This ensures seamless playback and user experience.

- **Tools Subdirectory**: Includes `dx`, `aapt`, and other developer utilities.
    

---

## 9. **System Directory**

Hosts core system-level libraries and services:

- **Init**: Handles Android OS bootstrap (`init.cpp`). This includes critical tasks such as mounting essential filesystems, launching the first set of system daemons, and parsing initialization scripts like `init.rc`. It ensures that core services, like the Zygote process and system servers, are started in the correct sequence to enable the operating system to function.
    
- **Core Libraries**: Includes utilities like `runas`, `fastboot`, and `gatekeeperd`.
    
- **CA Certificates**: Manages certificates and security policies.
