## Overview

This document summarizes the intricate process that occurs when an Android 14 device powers on, covering each stage from the initial electrical surge that activates the motherboard to the initialization of the Android operating system.

## Power-On Sequence

- **Electrical Surge:** Activates the motherboard and triggers the boot process.
    
    - The electrical surge energizes all the hardware components, including the CPU, RAM, and storage. This begins the chain reaction leading to system initialization.

## Boot ROM

- **Definition:** Boot ROM is a specialized memory location containing essential code for loading the bootloader into memory.
    
    - It is immutable and forms the foundation for system security, ensuring only trusted software is loaded initially.
        
- **CPU Awareness:** The CPU is hardcoded to know the Boot ROM address, varying across architectures.
    
    - This hardcoding ensures that the device consistently begins execution at the correct entry point.

## Bootloader Process

### Stages of the Bootloader:

1. **Initial Program Loader (IPL):**
    
    - Stored in the read-only memory.
        
    - Loads the Secondary Program Loader (SPL) into memory.
        
    - Simple and fast, without user interaction.
        
    - It performs minimal checks and transfers control to SPL as quickly as possible to speed up the boot process.
        
2. **Secondary Program Loader (SPL):**
    
    - Loads the kernel and other essential OS components into memory.
        
    - Sets up memory management, device drivers, virtual memory, and clocks.
        
    - It also validates the integrity of the kernel and ensures that the hardware is in a usable state before handing control to the kernel.
        

### Partitioning and Filesystem Parsing

- **Partition Table Reading:**
    
    - Stored in the Master Boot Record (MBR) or GUID Partition Table (GPT).
        
    - Identifies partitions for the bootloader, kernel, firmware, and Android system image.
        
    - By understanding the partition layout, the bootloader can efficiently locate and load critical components.
        
- **Filesystem Parsing:**
    
    - Reads metadata and directory entries to locate necessary files.
        
    - Console commands to explore partitions:
        
        - `ls -al /dev/block/platform/*` lists device partitions.
            
        - Use `dd` to dump boot partition data.
            
    - This step ensures proper loading of data from storage by verifying file locations and integrity.

## Kernel Initialization

- **Kernel Loading:**
    
    - Bootloader loads a compressed kernel image from the boot partition.
        
    - Kernel initializes essential services and starts the `init` process.
        
    - The kernel is responsible for setting up hardware abstraction, managing memory, and ensuring critical subsystems are operational.
        
- **Commands:**
    
    - Use `ps -ef` via ADB to analyze running processes.
        
    - This command is critical for monitoring and troubleshooting the boot process in real-time.

## Init Process

### Stages of Init Process:

1. **First Stage:**
    
    - Sets up the basic environment, including CPU, memory, and storage.
        
    - Mounts root, data, and cache filesystems.
        
    - Starts kernel threads and system services (e.g., `logd`, `ueventd`).
        
    - The focus is on creating a minimal runtime environment where higher-level processes can safely operate.
        
2. **Second Stage:**
    
    - Launches system services (e.g., `surfaceflinger`, `servicemanager`).
        
    - Starts user applications, system server, and managers.
        
    - At this stage, the device begins to resemble its operational state, with visible user-interface services starting.
        

### `init.rc` File

- Configuration file for system initialization.
    
- Contains commands to:
    
    - Mount filesystems.
        
    - Start core system services.
        
    - Manage environment variables and file permissions.
        
    - These settings ensure the system's integrity and usability.
        
- Supports importing additional `.rc` files.
    
    - Modular `.rc` files allow device-specific configurations to be included without modifying the core configuration.

## Boot-Up Processes and Process IDs

### Key Points About the Boot-Up Processes

1. **First Process:** `**init**`
    
    - The `init` process is the first user-space process started by the kernel.
        
    - It has a PID of **1** and is responsible for launching all other processes in the system.
        
    - The parent process of `init` is **PID 0**, the kernel itself.
        
    - It acts as the orchestrator, ensuring all critical services are started in a specific order.
        
2. **Kernel Threads (e.g.,** `**kthread**`**)**
    
    - Processes with names starting with `k` (like `kthread`) are kernel processes.
        
    - The kernel process (PID 2) spawns additional kernel threads.
        
    - These threads handle tasks such as memory management, hardware interactions, and system monitoring.
        
    - Kernel threads run in the background to maintain system stability and performance.
        
3. **Services Started by** `**init**`
    
    - The `**init.rc**` file specifies the services and daemons that `init` must start.
        
    - Services started during the **first stage** include:
        
        - `logd`: Handles system logs.
            
            - Collects and stores diagnostic information to aid in troubleshooting.
                
        - `ueventd`: Handles kernel events.
            
            - Detects hardware changes and ensures appropriate drivers are loaded.
                
        - `servicemanager`: Manages core system services.
            
            - Acts as a directory for available services, ensuring efficient inter-process communication.

- **Purpose:**
    
    - Separates system and vendor partitions to facilitate updates and enhance security.
        
    - Allows manufacturers to update system partitions without affecting vendor-specific configurations.
        
    - By isolating these partitions, the Treble architecture reduces fragmentation and ensures faster updates for users.

## Zygote Process

- **Definition:**
    
    - Initializes Android Runtime (ART) and Dalvik VM.
        
    - Starts system servers and application processes.
        
    - By preloading core libraries and services, it reduces app startup time.
        
- **Zygote Variants:**
    
    - `zygote` and `zygote64` manage 32-bit and 64-bit processes, respectively.
        
    - This dual-setup ensures compatibility with a wide range of applications.
