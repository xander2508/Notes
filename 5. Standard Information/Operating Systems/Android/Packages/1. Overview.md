Android APK/Packages are the applications which can be run on an Android device.

Packages each have ID's. The ID's can be located by searching for the application at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically. Where the package ID is in the URL.

## Split APKs

Traditionally APKs consist of a single universal APK file. However, Google play supports (Android Application Bundles) AAB files. 

An _Android App Bundle_ is a publishing format that includes all your app's compiled code and resources, and defers APK generation and signing to Google Play.

Google Play uses your app bundle to generate and serve optimized APKs for each device configuration, so only the code and resources that are needed for a specific device are downloaded to run your app. You no longer have to build, sign, and manage multiple APKs to optimize support for different devices, and users get smaller, more-optimized downloads.

To split an APK, developers can manually specify where the split happens in the Build.Gradle file
