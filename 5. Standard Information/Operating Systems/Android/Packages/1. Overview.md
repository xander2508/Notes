Android APK/Packages are the applications which can be run on an Android device.

Packages each have ID's. The ID's can be located by searching for the application at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically. Where the package ID is in the URL.

1. Java Compilation Stage

- **Source Code**: Written in Java or Kotlin.
- **Compilation**: The code is compiled into **Java Byte Code**.
- **Output**: Stored as `.class` files, executable by any Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

2. Android Compilation Stage

- The Android SDK **Dex Compiler** transforms the Java Byte Code into **Dalvik Executable (DEX)** format.
- **Input**: `.class` files → **Output**: `.dex` files.
- **Purpose**: DEX files are optimized for Android runtime.

3. Packaging for Distribution

- Android Package Manager combines:
    - **DEX files**
    - Essential resources (e.g., layouts, images)
- Creates a single APK file.
- **Signing**: The APK is signed with a **digital certificate** to ensure authenticity and integrity.

See [[APKTool]] for decompiling ([[Smali]])

## Download APKs

APK's can be downloaded either:
1. From the internet
	1. [Download APK on Android with Free Online APK Downloader - APKPure](https://apkpure.com/)
		- Contains old version at the bottom of the pages
	2. [⚡ APKCombo - #1 APK Downloader](https://apkcombo.com/)
		- To get the variants here or older version
	3. [APKMirror - Free APK Downloads - Free and safe Android APK downloads](https://www.apkmirror.com/)
1. From the device
	1. Using and application
		1. Download an APK extractor app onto the device
			- [App APK Extractor & Analyzer – Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ytheekshana.apkextractor&hl=en_GB)
		2. [[Android Debug Bridge (ADB)|ADB]] pull the files
	2. Manually extract using [[Android Debug Bridge (ADB)|ADB]]
		1. See [[Android Debug Bridge (ADB)#List installed packages|List installed packages]]
		2. Adb pull the package file path

## Static Reverse Engineering of APK Files

Static analysis involves inspecting the APK **without running it**. Steps:

1. **Unzip the APK**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `unzip Sarah.apk`
    
2. Inspect the unzipped contents:
    - **classes.dex**: Contains the compiled Dalvik executable code.
    - **AndroidManifest.xml**: Core file containing app permissions and metadata.
    - **resources/ folder**: Contains:
        - **Layout Files**: XML-based UI definitions (e.g., `main.xml`).
        - **Drawable Files**: Images in multiple resolutions (e.g., `.png`).

### Key APK Components

1. `classes.dex`

- Dalvik Executable code.
- Executed by Android Runtime.

2. `AndroidManifest.xml`

- Contains app permissions, activities, and intent filters.
- Note: The file may not always be human-readable.

3. `resources/`

- Contains UI components, strings, and assets:
    - **Layouts**: XML files defining user interface.
    - **Drawable**: Image resources.

4. `META-INF/`

- Contains:
    - **Certificates**: Ensures integrity of the APK.
    - **Manifest.mf**: Lists individual file signatures.

5. `resources.arsc`

- Binary file storing resource information like strings, styles, and colors.

## Inspecting Target SDK Version

To identify the target SDK version of an APK, use:

`aapt dump badging Sarah.apk | grep "Target SDK version"`

**Output**:

- `Target SDK version: 21`

### Pre-requisite:

- Ensure **Android SDK tools** are in the system’s environment variables to avoid errors (`aapt not found`).
