The Linux file system is based on the Unix file system, which is a hierarchical structure that is composed of various components. At the top of this structure is the inode table, the basis for the entire file system. The inode table is a table of information associated with each file and directory on a Linux system. Inodes contain metadata about the file or directory, such as its permissions, size, type, owner, and so on. The inode table is like a database of information about every file and directory on a Linux system, allowing the operating system to quickly access and manage files.

Files can be stored in the Linux file system in one of two ways:
- Regular files
- Directories
