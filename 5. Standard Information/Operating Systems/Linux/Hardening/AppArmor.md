AppArmor is also a MAC system that provides a similar level of control over system resources and applications as [[AppArmor]], but it works slightly differently. AppArmor is implemented as a Linux Security Module (LSM) and uses application profiles to define the resources that an application can access. AppArmor is typically easier to use and configure than SELinux but may not provide the same level of fine-grained control.
