SELinux is a MAC system that is built into the Linux kernel. It is designed to provide fine-grained access control over system resources and applications. SELinux works by enforcing a policy that defines the access controls for each process and file on the system. It provides a higher level of security by limiting the damage that a compromised process can do.
