Through static analysis, we endeavour to extract pivotal information which includes:

- File type
- File hash
- Strings
- Embedded elements
- Packer information
- Imports
- Exports
- Assembly code
## Identifying The File Type

See [[3. Exploitation/File Types and Data/1. Guide|Guide]]

## Calculating the Hash 


```shell-session
md5sum 
```

```shell-session
sha256sum 
```
