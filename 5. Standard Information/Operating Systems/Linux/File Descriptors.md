A file descriptor (FD) in Unix/Linux operating systems is an indicator of connection maintained by the kernel to perform Input/Output (I/O) operations. In Windows-based operating systems, it is called filehandle. It is the connection (generally to a file) from the Operating system to perform I/O operations (Input/Output of Bytes). By default, the first three file descriptors in Linux are:

1. Data Stream for Input
    - `STDIN – 0`
2. Data Stream for Output
    - `STDOUT – 1`
3. Data Stream for Output that relates to an error occurring.
    - `STDERR – 2`
