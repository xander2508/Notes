Services are stored within the path: `/etc/systemd/system/`

Systemd is a service used in Linux systems such as Ubuntu, Redhat Linux, and Solaris to start processes and scripts at a specific time. With it, we can set up processes and scripts to run at a specific time or time interval and can also specify specific events and triggers that will trigger a specific task. To do this, we need to take some steps and precautions before our scripts or processes are automatically executed by the system.

1. Create a timer
2. Create a service
3. Activate the timer

#### Create a Timer

To create a timer for systemd, we need to create a directory where the timer script will be stored.

  Task Scheduling

```shell-session
AlexanderOrley@htb[/htb]$ sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/system/mytimer.timer.d
AlexanderOrley@htb[/htb]$ sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/mytimer.timer
```

Next, we need to create a script that configures the timer. The script must contain the following options: "Unit", "Timer" and "Install". The "Unit" option specifies a description for the timer. The "Timer" option specifies when to start the timer and when to activate it. Finally, the "Install" option specifies where to install the timer.

#### Mytimer.timer

Code: txt

```txt
[Unit]
Description=My Timer

[Timer]
OnBootSec=3min
OnUnitActiveSec=1hour

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Here it depends on how we want to use our script. For example, if we want to run our script only once after the system boot, we should use `OnBootSec` setting in `Timer`. However, if we want our script to run regularly, then we should use the `OnUnitActiveSec` to have the system run the script at regular intervals. Next, we need to create our `service`.

#### Create a Service

  Task Scheduling

```shell-session
AlexanderOrley@htb[/htb]$ sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/mytimer.service
```

Here we set a description and specify the full path to the script we want to run. The "multi-user.target" is the unit system that is activated when starting a normal multi-user mode. It defines the services that should be started on a normal system startup.

Code: txt

```txt
[Unit]
Description=My Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/full/path/to/my/script.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

After that, we have to let `systemd` read the folders again to include the changes.

#### Reload Systemd

  Task Scheduling

```shell-session
AlexanderOrley@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

After that, we can use `systemctl` to `start` the service manually and `enable` the autostart.

#### Start the Timer & Service

  Task Scheduling

```shell-session
AlexanderOrley@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl start mytimer.service
AlexanderOrley@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl enable mytimer.service
```
